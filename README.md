# Sentiment Analysis on Internet Media

In todayâ€™s society, modern technology allows us to be ever more connected to one another. This is especially true with the advent of social media. Social media allows us to stay present and get the latest information on every topic imaginable. With high-speed internet access, social media can let just about anyone have a voice and share their thoughts and opinions on anything happening today. There are a multitude of different platforms for people to discuss their opinions, and many of these platforms are completely free. This gives way for many different people to give their opinions. Whether it's political debate, how their favorite sports team is doing, or opinions on a certain restaurant, there is something for everyone. However, there is a good chance that people might be overwhelmed when trying to look towards social media for opinions, as there are so many of them. How can someone know what the general sentiment on a topic is with so many different posts about the same topic?

We wanted to find a way to compile many different social media posts about a specific topic and find out what the general public feels. We collected data in the form of social media posts, then, using Python packages like VADER and TextBlob, analyzed what the general sentiment is around that particular topic from social media. The topics that we chose to discuss were far ranging and covered a multitude of areas.

## About this Repository
