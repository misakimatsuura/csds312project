43,cnirwr,False,None,329,Their shouldn't be any billionaires,Feminism,,https://i.redd.it/9k7geiqeq6f31.jpg,2587,"The heck. This is based on a poor understanding of economics. Money can be created or destroyed at will by federal reserve banks. So you can't ""run out of money"" by having people earn more. 

&#x200B;

In addition, spending money isn't universally ""good"". What, exactly, do you propose people spend their money on? A lot of essential items, like food, are already quite cheap. Others, like housing, do not increase in supply in reponse to increase deman (actually nothing does). In fact most people spend too much any way, especially poor people. Overspending for anyone but the rich incurs debt. And debt destablizes economies. So we really should do more to curb spending. 

&#x200B;

May I blow your mind though? If you look at any inflation adjusted stock index, it has gone up over time. Inflation adjusted meaning this is not explained by increases in money supply. Why is that? Why is it that wealth is created out of thin air? The reason being that econmic growth is not measured by mansions and yachts, but by increased productivity?

&#x200B;

Why do you think everyone can have a car these days? And we can all get medecines? And cell phones? Over time businesses have made these things more available and cheaper to manufacture. That didn't occur without innovation and risk. And the people that took said risk end up billionaires. 

&#x200B;

Here is the thing. Billionaires are a sign of progress. They are a sign that people are rewarded for working harder than the rest. They show that you take an idea, nurture it, and you will reap the benefits. And I get it. It is annoying that people are richer than you, but entertain the thought that they actually deserved some of that. 

&#x200B;

Now I am all for things like providing education for poor people. Doing something about drug companies taking advantage of price inelasticity. And reducing the cost of college. But we need to be sensitive to the actual price indicators and not be emotional and resentful of those that have more than us. 

&#x200B;

Because someone will always have more. Don't focus on them. Focus on yourself. By believing you are disadvantaged, you will be disadvantaged. But most of us, esp. in america, have a ton of potential. And the sooner we realize that, the better we  will all be. ",2019-08-08 08:25:08

325,ey49at,False,None,42,Sex Worker Killed After Paroled Murderer Allowed to Satisfy 'Sexual Needs',Feminism,"In Quebec City, a sex worker was murdered by a man previously sentenced to prison for brutally killing his female partner. The man's parole officer developed a strategy for allowing him to ""meet his sexual needs"" by purchasing sex - without any concern for the sex workers' safety and despite the fact that purchasing sex is illegal in Canada. 

The parole board considered a convicted murderer's ""sexual needs"" - as if he is entitled to sex - as a matter of higher priority than the safety of the women he was visiting. They didn't even inform the women of his criminal history. To these people, women are disposable - particularly sex workers. 

 [https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/daphne-bramham-allowing-paroled-murderers-to-visit-brothels-isnt-just-stupid-its-illegal-and-deadly](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/daphne-bramham-allowing-paroled-murderers-to-visit-brothels-isnt-just-stupid-its-illegal-and-deadly)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ey49at/sex_worker_killed_after_paroled_murderer_allowed/,1295,"Agreeing with everything being said above, but to go somewhat off track to discuss preventative measures for this type of thing. 

The obvious issue of how this man was being or not being supervised in the community appropriately is should be investigated which I imagine has been. But when they consider recommendations for change that they likely won't implement coz well ""she was a sex worker,"" will they actually consider enforced and improved step down approaches that include accommodation, intervention from forensic psychologist, justice program follow up, forensic risk management plans etc? Or will they over simplify it and just focus on the fact that he was allowed access to a sex worker? The issue is much more complex than that. 

Now looking at sex work side of things - if it was legal and appropriately regulated would these brothels have done a better job at protecting this girl? Would she have gone to the hotel to meet him? If the girls were well supported and they had strong policies in place and had authorities to report this man to, would it have happened? I mean, sure we can consider the parole aspect, but if he didn't have a parole officer and he was released with no parole, it still would have happened. This also needs investigating and reviewed.

I've learned a bit about feminism growing up, but it wasn't until I began entering the world as my own, individual person, that I ever felt much of a connection to this so-called 'feminism'.

But then, I grew up. 
I entered the real world. 
I learned of injustices ranging from severe human rights violations, down to subtle differences in social acknowledgment.

I began hearing of atrocities happening around the world, while also becoming more and more aware of when people treat me differently than a male counterpart.

And, to be honest? I'm tired.
I'm tired of explaining why that joke just isn't funny.
I'm tired of explaining why his advances are inappropriate.
I'm tired of explaining why progress doesn't negate the fact that there's still work to be done.
I'm tired of keeping my composure during someone's inappropriate behavior.
I'm tired of justifying why bodily autonomy is so important to me.
I'm tired of holding my tongue while his eyes slide over my body, as if I'm a piece of meat being considered in a market.

I'm tired of explaining that, no, feminism isn't about hating men.
I'm tired of breaking down the need for feminism to someone who has no interest in actually hearing them.
I'm tired of having to demonstrate that feminists care about issues involving men as well. 
I'm tired of having to prove why my experience does, in fact, matter.


I want to scream-
How do you know? 
Why don't you care? 
How can you justify that? 
What do you feel that you are owed by us?

I'm just... tired.

Anyway I brought up how he had essentially fuckzoned this girl and I've never seen someone go so red in embarrassment. It just instantly fucked with his resentment, and I could see a realisation in him that he probably didn't want to accept as he wouldn't talk to me the rest of the nightahahaha

507,9tn2c7,False,None,62,The clitoris is as easy to dissect as a finger. The nerves are about the same size (2-4 mm at the base and 1-2 mm where they dive to enter glans). Please clap to show support for dissemination of this anatomy. Better photos from my dissection study will be published soon.,Feminism,"https://link.medium.com/UG1e7jIxwR 

I know I‚Äôve posted before, but I really would appreciate more claps and shares. I have now dissected 7 clitoris with my father (plastic surgeon - I know it‚Äôs so awkward), and his plastic surgery residents. I was not able to get OB/GYNs interested in a study (unless they are doing it without, as one said she ‚Äúmight‚Äù), but you‚Äôll see support from one in a comment on my article. My ultimate goal is to influence them. 

I cannot share our photos yet, and they would probably gross most laypeople out, but they are the best ever taken. We even got cross sections where you can see how big the nerves are. I want the first correct illustrations of cross-sections to be based on them. 

I care about this because my clitoris was denervated due to pervasive physician ignorance of this anatomy. I need to change it to protect other women. Also, these nerves are large enough to potentially repair when injured. But surgeons first have to know where they are. Physical causes of sexual dysfunction should be understood so that women are not gaslighted and told it is just psychological. This is also important for any trans men who might be transiting.

The clitoral body is larger than most people realize. Lepidi and Di Marino reported the average length of the descending segment (part that looks like a penile shaft basically) is 3.24 cm on average, not including the 5.1  mm length of the glans. Our measurements, from where the clitoris attaches to the pubic bone to the base of the glans (‚Äúcorona‚Äù) have been 28 mm, 29 mm, 30 mm, 32 mm, and 35 mm (the first 2 were not measured). The body is also wider than recognized but we haven‚Äôt measured width except in one (sorry! It‚Äôs hard for me to control the measurements we take - I had to fight for the body lengths). 

The nerves are MUCH bigger than most doctors recognize. They were dissectible all the way up to the glans in most. I feel like it‚Äôs not a coincidence that they were dissectible within 2 mm of the glans in the last 4 dissected while I was there last weekend, but not in the first. Maybe it isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to follow these nerves out, but my dad says they are no harder to dissect than nerves in the finger. And they are larger than facial nerves surgeons learn in detail. 

The nerves are absolutely the most critical for female sexual function. They are important. They should be known, especially by surgeons doing surgery in this area. Clitoral anatomy should also be covered in the same depth as penile anatomy in sexual medicine literature. The clitoris is equal in importance to the penis to sexual response. 

This is a feminist issue because the reason this anatomy is so lacking is because of the way female sexuality is approached in our culture. This anatomy was illustrated accurately by Kobelt in 1844 (he shows more branching, but there has been variability in branching), but disappeared when doctors realized the clitoris was not involved in conception and Freud insisted on the vaginal orgasm. To this day, female orgasm is often seen as less important due to a lack of a direct role in reproduction. This is wrong. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/9tn2c7/the_clitoris_is_as_easy_to_dissect_as_a_finger/,978,"Sorry if this is off-topic, but I'm wondering if you can answer an anatomy/physiology question I have?

If so, here are my questions:

Are the bulb or crus of the clitoris relevant to sexual stimulation or pleasure? What do they (bulb + crus) do? Is it just the shaft and glans that give rise to feeling when stimulated?

(I have already looked up the clitoris before, but ""clitoris"" and ""glans clitoris"" seem to be used interchangeably in lay writing and even much ""enlightened"" sex-ed material. So I feel like when anyone mentions the 'clitoris"" or ""clit"" they just mean the glans! WTF! How is one to learn about the other parts??)

(Aside: This situation of poor educational materials available is a shame, because no one would get away with using ""penis"" and ""glans penis"" interchangeably for long.)

Edit (trying to answer my own question): I tried to read some of the excerpts of textbooks that are reviewed on Jess's Medium posts, and here's what I think they do:

- Crus seems to anchor the whole clitoris to the hip/pelvic bones, sort of like a cable bridge? And is also erectile tissue.
- Bulbs seem to be mostly erectile tissue.

I literally don't know what I'm talking about beyond paraphrasing some OB/GYN textbooks, but still this is clearer than any info I found trying to google it, so posting here in case anyone is curious. ",2018-11-02 19:07:44

In many videos, Abdullah √ñcalan (founder PKK/YPG) says that he sees women as toys and that ugly women have no place in the terrorist organization.

One of the videos.

This is the book written by Abdullah √ñcalan.

[https://odatv4.com/images/resimler/%C3%B6calan.jpg](https://odatv4.com/images/resimler/%C3%B6calan.jpg)

In the book, he writes the following statements for Kurdish women.

""**It may sound strange to some of them, but it is useful to open it. The bodies of most Kurdish women are dead, rotten, cold, and very rude. Their physique is a bit like this, their souls are dull. There is no level of opinion**""

So don't expect more than a terrorist organization that uses women as a suicide bombs. They are experts in telling lies.

What I mean is if two adults have consensual sex then they should take on the responsibility of the possibility of a child. I don't think a woman should go to jail for an abortion and I think that should be more at the fault of the doctor. Women who are victims of rape should be allowed to get a termination of the pregnancy,  same for any woman at risk of her health during pregnancy, or child is determined to have a lesser quality of life due to disability. That's me personally but I don't make laws and I respect those who have a different opinion. It's hard to say if it's morally okay to terminate something that would grow into a person or when it is and isn't okay.

&#x200B;

Main findings:

*   About 5 million employees are sexually harassed at work every year 
   * The overwhelming majority (99.8%) of people who experience sexual harassment at work never file formal charges 
   * Of those who file formal charges, very few‚Äîwe estimate less than 1,500 per year‚Äîgo to court. 
*  Most employers react punitively toward people who file formal sexual harassment charges. 
   * 68% of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of employer retaliation, this rate is highest for Black women. 
   * 64% of sexual harassment charges are associated with job loss, and this rate is highest for White women and White men. 
*  Industries vary widely in their sexual harassment discrimination charge rates. 
   *  In all industries women are more likely than men to file charges, but this sex difference grows in male dominated industries. 
* While the EEOC initially tends to judge sexual harassment charges as more likely than other discrimination complaints to sustain a finding of legal cause, most individuals benefit little from EEOC case processing 
   *  27% of employees who file a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC and continue to pursue redress, receive any benefit 
      *  23% receive some monetary compensation 
      *  the average award is $24,700, the median award is $10,000 
      *  less than 1% of awards are over $100,000 
      *  Only 12% of charges lead to a managerial agreement to change workplace practices 
* Our conclusion from these results is that sexual harassment, and perhaps discrimination of all types, should be addressed proactively and affirmatively as managerial responsibilities, rather than leaving it to the targets of discrimination to pursue legal remedies as individuals.

Hi, I am new to this subreddit, but I want to share this with you. I am Mexican, and on March 9th, we will hold a national strike. None of us will be visible (no school, no commerce, work, consumption or exposure) on the 9th because our government has been unable to help us stop the epidemic of femicides. We have a very strong victim blaming culture, and our judicial system has very light consequences for abusers. Most workplaces and universities are ""supporting"" the movement, but in reality most just say it and won't even justify the absences. 

I sincerely hope that this might make a difference as the world processes how an entire country will run without 51% of its population. 

I want to ask of you please, to wear something purple in solidarity with us on March 9th, as I know it is not feasible for everybody to miss work or school. We are so tired of not knowing if we will get home safe, if we will get groped in the streets, or if our daughters, sisters, mothers, grandmas and friends will be found in pieces, in plastic bags, and their name will become one more statistic. I am tired of  my  fallen sisters being blamed for their deaths because ""she was walking on the street"", ""she came on to me"", or "" I killed her because if she could not be mine, she could not be anyone else's"". I am tired of people saying we should not vandalize monuments, or stop working, when so many of us disappeared without a trace. The latest example was Ingrid Escamilla, 25 yo, who was brutally murdered by her husband, skinned, and the pictures of her mutilated body spread online. We are not respected even when we are dead. 

I know if I was a mom, and my daughter disappeared, I'd want them to burn the entire world down.

So please, from the bottom of my heart, wear something purple, and let the world know that we didn't forget them, and we will keep fighting one step at a time.

(It's just a similar melody). 

Whenever people talk about her on major subreddits, there's always hordes of people who absolutely *insist* that she couldn't possibly write her own songs.

But we only seem to have these ""discussions"" about female artists. (And especially pop). You don't see people arguing about whether or not Bruno Mars, or Michael Bubl√©, or Pharell Williams writes his own songs. It's exhausting.

Furthermore, people seem really mad about how Taylor's dad apparently used his money and connections to help her get started. But the same could have been said about, say, Michael Jackson.

* If the bill had passed, 17-year-olds would have been able to get married to someone within 4 years of their age with judicial approval if they provided evidence of maturity, stable housing, and a GED or high school diploma. Parental consent would not be required and married 17-year-olds would be automatically emancipated.
* Conservative lobbyists (notably the Family Foundation of Kentucky) opposed the bill because it defied ‚Äúparental rights‚Äù since parental consent would no longer be sufficient for 16- and 17-year-olds
* The bill specified that parental wishes are not ‚Äúsufficient evidence to establish that the best interests of the minor would be served by granting the petition for marriage.‚Äù

I did it because she wanted to finally call out the perpetrator but was afraid, so I offered to do it for her. It included a story about a teacher's failure to investigate the matter after she reported it.

After posting it, plenty of people who graduated at the school started reaching out to me about sexual harassment and bullying either done by or enabled by teachers. I've discovered this has been a long cycle of abuse, and I decided to contact someone from the school. My complaints have fallen on deaf ears, though. They just flat out told me that times have changed, the school wasn't the same as it used to be. And to be careful about posting about the school because I might get sued. 

I can't just ignore all these girls being sexually harassed by their teachers. Some of them have recently graduated and confirmed that this is still happening today. I want to fight for them but I'm also afraid to get into any legal trouble. (I live in the Philippines)

On top of this, we have this horrible piece of news reporting that in some parts of Uttarakhand, a state in India, no female children have been born for the past three months. This means every female foetus in these parts were aborted simply because of their sex.

733,bbqoyf,False,[Sexuality],152,Does anyone else feel that sex positive feminism has become toxic in some feminist circles?,Feminism,"Hear me out. I agree with being sex positive, but sometimes it seems like it's become a competition of who can be the most ""edgy"" or ""kinky"". It can make some women feel very inadequate, and like they SHOULD be doing things they aren't really comfortable with.

Like, I see the word ""vanilla"" thrown around as an insult constantly. It's pretty mean, because sexuality is a pretty complex thing- there are just so many social and psychological factors that can form and define somebody's sexuality. And making them feel bad for not being as kinky as someone else really doesnt help anyone's self esteem.

On the flip side, people who aren't kinky shouldn't shame those who are, either. And sometimes vanilla as an insult is a response to those people. But I also frequently see shit like this for no real reason..? 

Why cant people just accept that we all have differences instead of acting like one way of being a sexual person is better than another? Shouldn't that be what sex positive is about?

If people wanted to argue that more young women turning to sex work for money Is a growing issue, I would be on board. A woman shouldn‚Äôt feel like selling her body is her only option. That would be oddly enough, an actual way to help women in need and protect teenage girls. Of course that‚Äôs not the case. None of these men want to help these women, none of these men would even consider donating to a women‚Äôs charity because they don‚Äôt think the oppression of women exist anymore. Societal views on women are enough to argue that we are not ‚Äúequal‚Äù and aren‚Äôt treated with the same respect as men. Just because women can legally ‚Äúdo whatever they want‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean women don‚Äôt face a significant amount of societal pressure for so many things it‚Äôs ridiculous. A woman can‚Äôt even own her own body without men putting their 2cents regarding it. 

For clarity, I‚Äôm speaking about the men that shame women for sex work. Apparently, a woman benefitting from her own body is so obscene that these men feel the need to retaliate and get angry at women they don‚Äôt even fucking know. News flash, just because you are attracted to a woman doesn‚Äôt mean her actions are of ANY importance to you. YOU.DO.NOT.OWN.HER. I‚Äôm sorry that a chick you would fuck in the right circumstances isn‚Äôt all what you hoped to be, go look at the other women you thirst for on a daily basis. You are not loyal to her, so why would she have loyalty towards you or any of the other men that follow her only because she‚Äôs hot?

Women are grown ass adults that can hold themselves accountable and know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. We don‚Äôt need men‚Äôs approval and I don‚Äôt know why these men react to Onlyfans as if we do.

*****IF YOU ARE A ""NICE GUY"" WHO CLAIMS TO RESPECT WOMEN, BUT TURN AROUND AND CALL US ""BITCHES"" ""SLUTS"" ""FEMINAZI'S"" WHEN WE REFUSE YOUR ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL ADVANCES, THIS POST IS NOT FOR YOU. I, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR OPINIONS ON HOW WOMEN (AND MEN) ARE TREATED. WE ARE NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF.*****

I was at the bar earlier, walking back in from having a smoke, and some wife-beater-wearing-fuck-boy GRABS my waist, forcibly pulls me in, and demands that I kiss him. I looked at him and with a calm, but VERY stern voice, told him to let go of me, and to not touch me again. He was persistent, grabbing me with more force and continuing to demand that I kiss him.. 

He did not let go of me or stop grabbing me until I looked at his group of guy friends with a stare that said ""come get your fucking dog off of me"". One of them stepped in and told him to forget about it, they were leaving anyways. Only then did this asshole loosen his grip and walk away from me. 

WHY DO YOU RESPECT YOUR FRIEND TELLING YOU TO STOP MORE THAN YOU RESPECT A WOMAN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW TELLING YOU TO STOP? So I'm really angry.

Not once did I give even the slightest indication that he could touch me. I honestly didn't even notice his presence until he put his hands on me. I should have hit him square in the face right then and there, after I very clearly told him to take his hands off of me and he refused.

But that's the problem right? Us ""feminazis"" are overreacting. We are ""violent"". Our cries for help and our demands for personal space and respect, our screams of being uncomfortable, it is just us ""crazy bitches, sluts, whores"" getting what we deserve. 

This has turned into a drawn-out ramble, I am aware. But I think its very important. I guess the main message I want people to take away is, instead of saying ""NOT ALL MEN"" try saying ""THE MEN THAT ARE GIVING YOU A HARD TIME NEED TO BE STOPPED"". Once again, a very important PSA from yours truly.

ALSO, why am I being made to feel like I was in the wrong? Why am I made to feel like I should have brushed it off because he was drunk? Why am I trying to make excuses for HIS obscene and brash behavior? 

For far too long, men and women who have been harassed or abused in any way have felt the need to make excuses for their abusers behavior. ""They were drunk."" ""I started the argument."" ""They are only angry because they care so much."" 

THAT IS ENOUGH. NO MORE EXCUSES. Drunk guy at the bar isn't being held accountable for his actions? Then neither am I, tell your face to say hello to the curb üôÉ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/94i79k/why_some_women_avoid_going_out_like_it_is_their/,638,[removed] ,2018-08-04 10:27:58

835,a09106,False,None,135,"Instead of teaching girls of ways not to get raped, we need to teach our boys not to rape.",Feminism," Seriously, telling girls ways of not getting raped is basically implying it‚Äôs their fault for not being prepared when they do get raped. Like telling them how to dress and not to go get drunk isn‚Äôt gonna work all the time and is also saying that if they ever do such things, they should expect themselves to be raped, causing to believe they only have themselves to blame when it does happen. What this does is that it leads to is a culture of victim-blaming and lack of reporting of sexual violence that needs to stop. People often say this is only a problem in Muslim countries, but it's an issue we need to combat regardless of what country we live in. Even in ""developed"" places like Japan and the US people are often kicked out of the house and take the blame for being raped and ending up with an unwanted child. Again, it should never be a girl‚Äôs fault if she does get raped , instead we should be teaching our boys not to rape. Rape is only the fault of the rapist. Period. 

A common argument to this is to just not go out with random strangers you meet at a party or bar. The problem with this is that nobody is deliberately going to clubs so they can get raped and some aren't going there for the sake of having sex or meeting someone. That's like saying if you go to a sporting event, don't be surprised if someone tries to attack you because of a Jersey you're wearing, and that would never be socially acceptable behaviour. Often times the rapist could even be some random guy who found a random girl on the street and not even bother trying to talk to the victim. Rape is about power, not attraction. Hell, there are cases where refusing to go with a man can trigger a man to want to rape. Rape isn't about attraction, it's about asserting power. The Junko Furuta case is a good example of this. Even when you're not at a bar, you can even be at school or on your commute home and some guys are still gonna try to find a way to rape you no matter what preparation you made. If anything, the culture of victim blaming needs to stop because that's the kind of mentality often taught in the media and sometimes reinforced by parents. That's why it's important to teach our kids especially that they shouldn't rape.

However, the female interest, who is the narrator of the film, has no depth. Other characters eluded to her being 'delicate' but nothing is built on her, she just serves as a plot device. Now this is nothing new despite frustrating. What is beyond frustrating for me personally is movies that pepper in sexual abuse/rape/domestic abuse like seasoning for impact. As a survivor of all three and who suffers from fairly severe PTSD at the moment, it came out of nowhere. My partner had to wrap his arm round my head to close my ears/shut my eyes pretty damn sharpish. Again, unfortunately, this is nothing new and somewhat maddeningly shrugged it off.

But the real cherry on the top, is that the film then uses this tormented woman's suicide as a redemption for the main male character. He visits her in the morgue and puts her wedding ring back on, despite when she was alive she wanted nothing more to do with him. And the film *wanted* you to feel like he was a good guy deep down. This continues the narrative that a bit of beating/rape is okay if you say sorry afterwards, that even the men who really love their wives do this sometimes. That forcing a dead woman to wear the wedding rings she took off because her husband attacked her is somehow romantic. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't that he did it, because people do do these things, it was that the direction of the film was that it was romantic and sympathetic to him, that the abusive gangster was just misunderstood.

Two men who sexually assaulted a female soldier in Korean army for ""being lesbian"" both separately have been found not guilty by the High Court for Armed Forces.

in  2010, a female soldier ""A"" was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Lieutenant Commander ""B"" and was made pregnant.

After she got an abortion, she told Commander ""A"" what happened, but instead, he sexually assaulted her as well. 

According to her, after she told ""B"" about her sexuality, he replied ""That's because you don't know about men. I'll teach you how it feels"" and sexually assaulted her.

Suffering from PTSD, she reported it in 2016 and the perpetrators were arrested last September.

 She pressed charges against them, in a first trial, ""B"" was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and ""A"" to 8 years.  But the HCAF overturned the first ruling, acquitting ""B"" today(Nov. 19. 2018). Commander ""A"" was already acquitted on Nov. 8.

I have always taken equality for granted. Within my living memory, I have perceived little to no inequality. I was not raised by a feminist. My mother was a strong, independent woman who was the breadwinner for our family. I always assumed that women's rights have been entrenched in society for a very long time. I don't know exactly how long ago I assumed that these rights were achieved, but I never really thought about it.

I just finished watching the Netflix documentary ""Feminists."" I don't even know what prompted me to press play. But oh boy, was it an eye-opener. The images of the rallies, the stories from women who had terrible experiences, and they're not even that old. It wasn't so long ago.

I had no idea how much these women had fought for. They built a better world for me, and I took it for granted. Some of them, I even knew of in some capacity, but nothing beyond the superficial surface of their work. What especially bothered me as I watched the documentary was the memories of my family making fun of Jane Fonda because of the time that she had done aerobics videos. I wonder if they knew about her contributions to furthering women's rights, or if they chose to just ignore this and reduce her to a ditzy actress, just in it for the money.

I cried a few times during the documentary. I want to reach out to these women and thank them for all they've done to make the world a better place for the next generations. It's so sad how people my age view feminism now; we don't fully grasp why it's necessary and so many people equate it with ""man-hating."" I myself am guilty of shying away from the term, preferring to say ""egalitarian"" when asked. From now on, I will be proud to say I am a feminist, and will dedicate time to learning about the history from which I benefit.

Today, he came up to my desk, again, and was like: ""Young and beautiful as always! Smile a bit.""

Hi as an 18 year old female ive watched a lot my friends let things go in relationships in order to ‚Äúnot cause trouble‚Äù, ‚Äúnot be that girl‚Äù, ‚Äúnot start issues‚Äù.

She was allegedly being held as a sex slave at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who was a friend of Trump's and is a convicted pedophile with a preference for young girls. After the alleged attack from Trump ended, the girl says Epstein proceeded to rape her. An employee of Epstein's witnessed the rape and corroborates the survivor's story. Trump has been accused of a violent rape before by his ex-wife Ivana Trump, and of attempted rape by a former business colleague.

The mainstream media hasn't reported on this lawsuit, reminiscent of the underreporting of the Cosby rape allegations for over a decade. Another sign that the media reflects the interests of the wealthy and powerful. Infuriating.
