To those joining us from r/all and r/popular:

We purposely posted this announcement a day in advance to give frequent visitors an opportunity to subscribe before we disappear from those pages, not expecting that the post itself would make it to the top of r/all. Sorry if this generates any confusion.

If you're a new subscriber, welcome! Please [**read the guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) before participating.

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralPolitics on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

Thank you.

As of yesterday, 21 November 2017, Ajit Pai, the current head of the Federal Communications Commission, [announced](https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/933009189991079936?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) plans to roll back Net Neutrality regulations on internet service providers (ISPs). The proposal, which an FCC press release [has described](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1121/DOC-347868A1.pdf) as a return to a ""light touch regulatory approach"", will be voted on next month.

The FCC memo claims that [the current Net Neutrality rules](https://www.cnet.com/news/13-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-fccs-net-neutrality-regulation/), brought into place in 2015, have ""depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation"". Supporters of Net Neutrality [argue](https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now) that the repeal of the rules would allow for ISPs to control what consumers can view online and price discriminate to the detriment of both individuals and businesses, and that investment [may not actually have declined](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/in-anti-net-neutrality-push-fcc-downplays-data-that-contradicts-narrative/) as a result of the rules change.

Critics of the current Net Neutrality regulatory scheme argue that the current rules, which treat ISPs as a utility subject to special rules, is [bad for consumers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/07/07/why-treating-the-internet-as-a-public-utility-is-bad-for-consumers/) and other problems, like the lack of competition, [are more important](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/we-dont-need-net-neutrality-we-need-competition/).

**Some questions to consider:**

* How important is Net Neutrality? How has its implementation affected consumers, businesses and ISPs? How would the proposed rule changes affect these groups?
* What alternative solutions besides ""keep/remove Net Neutrality"" may be worth discussing?
* Are there any major factors that haven't received sufficient attention in this debate?

We announced this [a few days ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/548hi7/announcing_our_debate_factchecking_initiative/) but here are the basics of how this will work:

* **Mods will post top level comments with quotes from the debate.**

This job is exclusively reserved to NP moderators.  We're doing this to avoid duplication and to keep the thread clean from off-topic commentary.  Automoderator will be removing all top level comments from non-mods.



* **You (our users) will reply to the quotes from the candidates with fact checks.**

All replies to candidate quotes must contain a link to a source which confirms or rebuts what the candidate says, and must also explain why what the candidate said is true or false.

Fact checking replies without a link to a source will be summarily removed. No exceptions.

* **Discussion of the fact check comments can take place in third-level and higher comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules still apply.

Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the ""replace"" part of their ""repeal and replace"" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes ""per-capita block granted""

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

**Is the new bill viable as an alternative to Obamacare? A solution to America's healthcare issues? Who currently supports and opposes it, and whose support is still needed?**

In particular this email exchange is getting a lot of attention:

>Good morning

>Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.

>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.

>I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.

All 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, 35 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate, 39 state and territorial governorships, various state ballot initiatives, as well as numerous other state and local elections will be contested.

**Voting FAQ:**

Q: Is it too late to register to vote?     
A: It depends. Some states have same-day registration. [Look up your state's information here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)

Q: Where do I vote on Election Day?     
A: Voters are assigned a polling place based on the address where they're registered. [Find your polling place here.](https://www.headcount.org/find-your-polling-place/)

Q: What are the hours of my polling place?     
A: [Find the opening and closing times for your polling place here.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_\(2018\))

Q: Do I need to show identification to vote?     
A: Most states require some form of identification either when you register and/or when you vote. The rules vary state by state. [This interactive map will help you determine the requirements for your state.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect)

Q: Where can I research what's on my ballot?     
A: Per [this recent thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9kwm02/best_website_to_get_ballot_summaries_that_are_as/) check out [BallotReady,](https://www.ballotready.org/) [OnTheIssues,](http://www.ontheissues.org/) [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/) [We Vote,](https://wevote.us/) or the website for your state's Secretary of State.

Q: Am I required to vote for every item on the ballot.     
A: No. Your ballot is still valid if you leave some contests without a vote.

Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?     
A: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.

So, now that the experiment has ended, what did we learn? Can we extend the conclusions to other states, or was there something specific about the economic situation in Kansas that caused it to have the results it did? Are there states similar to Kansas that did not enact such policies that we can use as a control? Have other states or countries had significantly different results from forays into supply-side economic policy?

The United States has [the highest rate of guns per capita in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) at about 1 gun per resident, nearly twice as high as the next highest country, Serbia, which has about 0.58 guns per resident.

That number however masks a fairly uneven distribution of firearms.  [Roughly 32-42% of Americans report that they live in a household with guns,](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/guns-dont-know-how-many-america/index.html) though the only data we have come from surveys, and therefore there is a margin of error.

Both of the principal surveys showed that rates of gun ownership declined from the 1970s-1990s and have been about steady since.

Surveys also estimate that among gun owners, the number of firearms owned is highly skewed, with a very small portion of the population (about 3%) [owning half of all firearms in the US.](https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/)

The US also has a very high rate of homicide compared to peer countries, and an about average suicide rate compared to peer countries.  [Firearm homicides in the US are much more common than all homicides in any peer country](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/) however even US non-firearm homicides would put the US above any western country except the Czech Republic.  The total homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 is more than twice as high as the next highest (Czech) homicide rate of 2.6 per 100,000.

The US has a much higher firearm suicide rate than peer countries (6.3 per 100,000) but a fairly low non-firearm suicide rate, which puts the US about middle of the pack on suicides. (same source as above paragraph)

A few basic Q&As to start:

**What is the AHCA?**

It is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.

**What does it do?**

Lots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)

**What are the recent amendments to it?**

There have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:

* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for ""high risk pools"" for persons with pre-existing conditions.

**What's going on with it now?**

House leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.

**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)

The House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)

**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.


The AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.

**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.

**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.

29,aua5l6,False,None,272,A Federal judge ruled on Friday that an all-male military draft is unconstitutional. What impact does this have on Selective Service registration and future U.S. military drafts?,NeutralPolitics,"Formed in 1917, the [Selective Service System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_System#Who_must_register) is an independent Federal agency that keeps records of individuals registered for a potential military draft.

Failure to register used to result in penalties, however these have not been prosecuted in many years (from Source 1):

> The last prosecution for non-registration was in January 1986. In interviews published in U.S. News & World Report in May 2016, current and former Selective Service System officials said that in 1988, the Department of Justice and Selective Service agreed to suspend any further prosecutions of non-registrants. No law since 1980 has required anyone to possess, carry, or show a draft card, and routine checks requiring identification virtually never include a request for a draft card.

In practice, the last draft was decades ago and enrolling in the military is voluntary today, however the Selective Service has several administrative roles not pertaining to the military. Some of these administrative roles incentivize enrollment (from Source 1):

> Registration with Selective Service is also required for various federal programs and benefits, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), student loans and Pell Grants, job training, federal employment, and naturalization.

----

In 1981, the Supreme Court in [Rostker v. Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostker_v._Goldberg) upheld the constitutionality of the all-male draft. This decision was partly determined based on the limited roles women could have in the military at the time.

On Friday, a [Federal judge ruled](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/24/military-draft-judge-rules-male-only-registration-unconstitutional/2968872002/) that women have sufficient access to combat roles in the military and that Rostker v. Goldberg no longer applies.

The [judge's ruling](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5747780-190224-SELECTIVE-SERVICE-DECISION-Full.html) (PDF warning) was a [Declaratory Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_judgment), and probably doesn't have great implications right now (from Source 3):

> ""Yes, to some extent this is symbolic, but it does have some real-world impact,"" said Marc Angelucci, the lawyer for the men challenging the draft. ""Either they need to get rid of the draft registration, or they need to require women to do the same thing that men do.""

---

I have a couple of questions:

1: How does a Declaratory Judgment work, and what does it do?

2: Does this ruling have any effect on the Selective Service System in the immediate? What about if another draft were to be held?

Of course there will be no mention of Manfort working for the Podesta Group during the dates in question, the Praetorian guard media will omit this as they have omitted so much other info damaging to the Clintons and Democrats in general.

>Lobbying powerhouse the Podesta Group filed paperwork with the Justice Department today acknowledging that its work years ago for a European nonprofit benefited the same Ukrainian political party once advised by Paul Manafort, who later ran Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.  **The filings, obtained by POLITICO, appear to clean up the firm’s requirement to disclose its role in foreign lobbying that Manafort reportedly orchestrated.**  https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/paul-manafort-lobbying-ukraine-podesta-group-237163

The reality is this has nothing to do with Trump whatsoever.

Edit: Perhaps the mods can use this to justify unhiding my other posts as this supports with facts what are in those posts.

Analysis by a 20 year federal prosecutor of the indictments:  Thin and overcharged.

Question:  Since Manafort was under investigation by the FBI back in 2014 when Obama was POTUS and Comey was in charge at the FBI and Lynch/Holder were AG, why didn't they charge Manafort then?  

Question: If the Mueller team of 20 odd prosecutors have complete access to tax records, bank records and all the material seized in the pre-dawn raid of Manafort's home, why are they pursuing charges that should be handled by a normal prosecutor and have nothing to do with Trump/Russia collusion?  Months of investigation and digging and this is all they have? 

Why is Mueller violating double jeopardy principles by charging two different false statement law violations, number 11 and 12, for the same false statement?

Count 2 is for money laundering, but for it to stick the money had to be criminal proceeds BEFORE Manafort tooks possession of it, no matter how much he moved it around after it was in his possession, and there is not proof or indication that it was, and Manafort HAD TO KNOW THE MONEY WAS ILLEGAL before he took it.

Bottom line is THERE IS NOT ACTIONABLE COLLUSION CASE HERE and that's to President Trump's benefit and provides a great case that this is just a witch hunt.

---

In practice, the way this would work is your state electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote instead of your state vote.

**For example, if you live in California and a Democrat won the state popular vote 57%-43%, the Democrat would typically be given the whole 55 electoral votes California has.**

**In this new system, California would look to the winner of the national popular vote. If California still voted 57%-43% for a Democrat and the national vote was 51%-49% in favor of a Republican, the state would give their 55 votes to the Republican.**

---

On the mechanism (from 2nd source):

> The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states' electors (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide (the ""winner-take-all"" system).

On enactment (from the 3rd source):

> “When we hit 270, all these bills take effect simultaneously. Then there’s a pool of 270 electoral votes that’s going to go to whomever gets the most votes in all 50 states,” Koza added.

I have a couple of questions:

1: Is this constitutional? When and where will this be determined if it's not?

2: States aren't exactly getting rid of their electoral votes - they're just writing legislation that changes the prerogative of their electors. What power do states have over their electors?

>I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.


>For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us.


>No more.


>The investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.


>The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.


>But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.


>Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday's comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.


>This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.


>I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.


>I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred.

However, shortly before her testimony could begin, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Republican Matt Gaetz of the Flordia 1st, held a short press conference in the ""basement of the Captial"" in which they laid out complaints about the secrecy of the testimony and of the impeachment inquiry itself.

1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?

For example, black people are actually not victims of white racism. White racism is in fact so rare that many of the 'hate crimes' such as black church vandalism etc were actually perpetuated by blacks and liberals to make their 'cause' look more legit. This much is at least admitted by the media in individual cases. 4 different ones I know off the top of my head.

In fact, the opposite is true. White people are constantly victims of black racism. There is effectively lynchings of white people every day...however the method of execution is not by lynching. Burning white people to death seems to be the preferred method.

There is a pervasive and energetic propaganda campaign against white people in commercials and television and movies. You will notice this quickly if you simply watch TV and decide to be aware of it. Whenever a character is evil or whenever a character is stupid, it's a white guy. Try to tell me a single evil or stupid character from any movie in the past 15 years who wasn't white?

Despite the existence of anti white racist policies in the letter of the law under the umbrella term 'affirmative action', white people are still widely perceived to have institutional privilege and many organizations actually call for white people to pay reperations for slavery...as if white people invented the concept of slavery.

In academia which are mainly controlled by the left...history classes focus on every bad thing white people did...while ignoring or trivializing the contributions white people made. Everyone in school quickly learns about  the worst slave owners and small pox blankets. Most people never learn about William Wilberforce or William murray or the massacre committed by tecumseh.

Thanks to drastically declining birth rates and increasing suicides, the white race is actually in the process of dying off. Feminism has much to do with this because the majority of feminists are white. We are 'projected' to be a minority in the us in about 30 years...the reality is actually probably much sooner. Europe will likewise meet a similar shift especially with people like Marcozy insisting that whites must practice miscegenation for the greater good.

The alt right is really composed of people who have noticed this rather unfair and racist war against white people. Its an attempt to counter ethnic cleansing programs against us. Obviously if you choose to remain oblivious to the reality that is never spoken of then it would appear to be white supremacist...especially because the media has brainwashed people into thinking that anyone who is concerned for the welfare of whites must be white supremacist since 'obviously' we are privileged and 'obviously' we controlled everything.

### Absolute immunity definition.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity) has the following definition:

> Absolute immunity is a form of legal immunity for government officials that confers total immunity from criminal prosecution and lawsuits so long as they are acting within the scope of their duties.

[Julian Epstein](https://www.nationalmemo.com/former-counsel-hicks-cant-claim-absolute-immunity-may-invoke-fifth-amendment/), former Democratic chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee says:

> “Absolute immunity would be a claim by the White House that none of the staff or the president need to answer any questions in a congressional proceeding or a legal proceeding,” Epstein explained to CNN, quickly adding that when President Richard Nixon tried to claim absolute immunity during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no such thing.

Chairman Nadler characterizes it on pg 11 of the transcript as:

> Chairman Nadler: With all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/explainer-congressional-testimony-limits/index.html) references a [OLC memo](https://www.justice.gov/file/30896/download) from 2014 which states:

> For the President’s absolute immunity to be fully meaningful, and for these
separation of powers principles to be adequately protected, the President’s
immediate advisers must likewise have absolute immunity from congressional
compulsion to testify about matters that occur during the course of discharging
their official duties.

Pg. 21.

> Chairman Nadler: In other words, you are asserting absolute immunity that she cannot testify as to any knowledge of anything that occurred after the President was inaugurated?

> Mr. Purpura: For the purpose of this hearing, yes.

...

> Mr. Purpura: Under the terms of the absolute immunity described in Mr. Cipollone's letter, she may not speak about anything that occurred during the time of her employment in the White House as a close adviser to the President.

Chairman Nadler asks if a non-existent war happened.

> Chairman Nadler: Did a war break out between Israel and Egypt during that time period?

> Mr. Purpura: Same objection.

In part, the policy states

""The Attorney General directed United States Attorneys on the Southwest Border to prosecute all amenable adults who illegally enter the country, including those accompanied by their children, for 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), illegal entry.

""Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).""

While the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why

[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.

Additionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.

The ""zero tolerance"" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that ""[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/). ""

On the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because ""the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held"", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested. ORR is currently sharing sponsor information with DHS, further stoking these fears. According to [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html) CNN article, the House is currently debating a bill that would overrule the 20 day limit, allowing families to be kept indefinitely at ICE family facilities.

In the letter, Barr relates that Mueller said:

>[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

The letter further states that Mueller investigated whether the President obstructed justice in relation to the investigation.  The report, according to Barr:

>sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.  The Special Counsel states that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

The letter then says it was left to Barr to decide whether the conduct constituted obstruction.  He says that he and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ""have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""

The letter further states that most of the factual information related to obstruction was ""the subject of public reporting.""

Mueller [was appointed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download) in 2017 to investigate  ""any links and/or coordination bet ween the Russian government and individuals

",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/aymbyf/today_paul_manafort_was_sentenced_to_47_months/,1067,"There are philosophical issues here with whether any incarceration sentence can ever be appropriate.

There is an inherent limit on the number of *different* possible sentences. A man who gets 5 years and 1 day incarceration will not feel his sentence is much harsher than the one who gets only 5 years even. They're granular, and it is a rather coarse granularity.

After 2 or 3 years, only an increment of 6 months counts as more, and soon after that, only an increment of a full year counts as more.

There is a natural maximum, in that there is a mean age at sentencing and that any sentence that puts you past your life expectancy at that age is effectively a life sentence. This maximum is lower still, in that if you are released with just a few years left of ill health (or even dementia), it's still a life sentence. This is probably around 25 years, give or take.

So, effectively, there are only around 30-40 distinct/different sentences possible, total.

There are many more potential crimes than this number, and many that we feel should each get a different punishment.

What this means in a practical sense is that there will always be cases where you say ""but this guy only did this petty thing, and he's getting the same sentence as the guy who slaughtered children and raped their corpses"". Mathematically, it's almost certainly unsolvable.

When people complain about his sentence, what they're really saying  is ""he committed a crime that's as bad as the worst murders, and deserves a comparable sentence to those crimes"". ",2019-03-08 04:55:40

[Those articles of impeachment are available here.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) (PDF)

There are two articles.  I will briefly excerpt the core allegations from each:

* **Article I: Abuse of Power**

>Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponents, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engage in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.

* **Article II: Obstruction of Congress**

>The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former officials.  

>In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself the functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the ""sole Power of Impeachment"" vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.

The articles then proceed to describe the means by which the alleged actions were undertaken.  



*  Are the factual claims in the two articles of impeachment supported by evidence from testimony, documentation, or other sources?  Is there any countervailing evidence that shows them to be in doubt?

* Are the legal claims in the two articles of impeachment accurate? Do they comport with past cases of impeachment, criminal law, or other sources of law?

According to the law that created and defined the CFPB, if the director position is vacant, the acting director takes over until a new permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.  Cordray's deputy thus took over as acting director ... but Trump just named a new acting director.  He claims he has authority to do this under the vacancies act, which lets the president fill vacancies with temporary people until permanent ones are nominated and confirmed.  This doesn't seem to make sense to me, because the law says who the acting director is and thus there's no vacancy there, and the permanent director is a position he can only fill either with Senate confirmation or a recess appointment.  But Trump's office of legal counsel signed off on it and says it's legal.

What's the precedent here?  What's the law?  Is what Trump is trying to do, actually legal?

This very much reminded me of the Supreme Court decision last Summer in [Trump v. Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Hawaii), (commonly called the 'travel ban'), where the court sided with the President. 

The similarity comes from several lower court decisions that used Trump's [history of disparaging comments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/20/i-think-islam-hates-us-a-timeline-of-trumps-comments-about-islam-and-muslims/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8e683f19c5ae) to find decisions that [ruled against the President](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/travel-ban-blocked.html):

> The cases have presented the rare spectacle of a president’s own words undercutting the legal arguments of his administration. The government’s position is that the latest ban, like those before it, is not an attempt to prevent Muslims from entering the United States, but a bid to limit and control who enters from some of the world’s most dangerous countries.

> Judge Chuang quoted extensively from Mr. Trump’s statements and Twitter messages during the campaign and in office, including his demand as a candidate for “a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” his calls for “a Muslim ban,” and a remark that because his statements had upset some people, he was “talking territory instead of Muslim.”

At the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the President had ample statutory authority to make national security judgements when it came to immigration, and [addressed the comments cited by lower courts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html):

> Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that Mr. Trump had made many statements concerning his desire to impose a “Muslim ban.” He recounted the president’s call for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” and he noted that the president has said that “Islam hates us” and has asserted that the United States was “having problems with Muslims coming into the country.”

> ...

> “The issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. **“It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.”**

> “In doing so,” he wrote, “we must consider not only the statements of a particular president, but also the authority of the presidency itself.”

I just have one question:
 
Does the Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. Hawaii impact whether Trump's comments can be used effectively in litigation? As in, did the Supreme Court set precedent that would have weight in the lower courts about how Trump's personal comments can be used? Must Trump's comments be viewed separately from officially written and submitted presidential directives?

#Constitutional Provisions

[The Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) has three clauses describing the process of impeachment:

*Article II, Section 4*

>The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States,
shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

*Article I, Section 2*

>The House of Representatives ...
shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

*Article I, Section 3*

>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for
that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the
United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be
convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or
Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to
Law.

#Process Overview

There are three essential steps:

1. The House votes (by a simple majority) to impeach the President.

2.  The Senate holds a trial, with the Chief Justice presiding.  

3.  The Senate votes on guilt, with 2/3 of Senators needing to vote ""guilty"" to convict.

#Process in the House of Representatives

The House has fairly broad discretion in what steps they take prior to voting on an impeachment resolution. 

[Pelosi indicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) that the six standing committees of the House will forward impeachment related materials to the Judiciary Committee, which will consider articles of impeachment and, if approved, forward them to the House for consideration.

If the House decides to vote to impeach, they will need to draft specific articles of impeachment laying out the alleged acts for which the President is to be tried.

I am including as examples copies of the articles of impeachment against [Andrew Johnson](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7), [Bill Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/articles122098.htm), and the articles adopted by the Judiciary Committee in respect to [Richard Nixon.](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/rnimparticles.htm)

After voting to approve articles of impeachment, the House will appoint ""managers"" who will act as the prosecution for the trial in the Senate.

#Process in the Senate

The Senate process is much more formalized, and structured as a trial.  The Senate adopted the current rules for impeachment trials [in 1986.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/impeach/senaterules.pdf)

The Senate can either conduct the trial before the full Senate, or before a committee, which would report its transcript to the full Senate.  The full Senate must vote on guilt or acquittal.  

If questions of evidence or procedure arose the presiding officer (the Chief Justice, for the trial of the President) would rule on them, but could be overridden by a vote of the Senate.

During the trial of Bill Clinton, [witnesses were deposed on videotape and the tape played to the Senate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton#Senate_trial)   Witnesses were heard live in the Senate during [Andrew Johnson's trial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson#Trial)

After the trial the Senate would move into a closed session to deliberate, and then vote in open session.  Two thirds of senators voting must vote ""guilty"" on a count to convict.

#After a finding of guilty or not guilty

If the President were found guilty on any count of the impeachment, he would immediately be removed from office and the Vice President would immediately become President.  The Senate would then vote on whether to disqualify the ex-President from ""any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.""  The disqualification vote would be by a simple majority.

If the conduct which was the subject of the impeachment were also an ordinary crime, the ex-President could separately be tried for that crime.

If found not guilty, the President would continue in office.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/d8vz0o/mod_post_an_overview_of_the_impeachment_process/,978,[removed] ,2019-09-25 00:36:00

88,7utdei,False,None,768,"Nunes Memo: What is true, what is misleading? What is new, what was previously known? And what are potential consequences for the investigations into Russian election meddling?",NeutralPolitics,"Hi folks,

I'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)

With all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.

I'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.

Regarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?

Regarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?

Regarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.

Regarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.

That's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well.

Is this a valid explanation? Must an Ambassador to the United States comply with any order or direction the State Department gives them? Is there anywhere the State Dept’s powers are enumerated in this regard? 

Would ordering a subpoena have made the process significantly less “expedited”? What benefit is there to not subpoenaing someone in a high-profile case like this?

Additionally, the Miami Herald reports Acosta's non-prosecution agreement ""essentially shut down"" an ongoing FBI probe into linked crimes and victims, may have granted immunity to potential co-conspirators that were left unnamed, and that Acosta may also have violated Federal law when he [failed to notify](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) victims of Epstein of this deal:

> Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records.

> The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators’’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.

> As part of the arrangement, Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims. As a result, the non-prosecution agreement was sealed until after it was approved by the judge, thereby averting any chance that the girls — or anyone else — might show up in court and try to derail it.

There were [36 victims cited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48925932) in court documents.

This 2008 deal by Acosta has come under scrutiny because of [new charges against Epstein](https://www.apnews.com/f995d90cbfd943169f74a0dbb3b1eadc). 

Acosta has defended the deal as appropriate (from Source 3):

> “At the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor’s office decided that a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail, that guarantees he register [as a sex offender] generally and guarantees other outcomes, is a good thing,’’ Acosta said of his decision to not prosecute Epstein federally.

I have a few questions on this topic:

1) What authority did Alexander Acosta have to make the punishment against Jeffery Epstein more severe? How much responsibility on deciding the sentencing rests with Acosta?

2) Was Jeffery Epstein's punishment on ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14"" in the state of Florida unusual? In terms of time served, fines, sex registration, and prison/jail treatment, what evidence is there that Epstein was given preferential treatment?

3) Several prosecutors have stated Acosta's deal was unusual in terms of how Epstein was treated, but also how it affected an FBI probe and granted immunity to potential co-conspirators.

This was later codified slightly differently in 1992 under [42 U.S.C. § 6322(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6322):

> (c) Mandatory features of plansEach proposed State energy conservation plan to be eligible for Federal assistance under this part shall include—

> > ...

> > (5) a traffic law or regulation which, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with safety, permits the operator of a motor vehicle to turn such vehicle right at a red stop light after stopping and to turn such vehicle left from a one-way street onto a one-way street at a red light after stopping; and

---

While many cities have 'no right turn on red light' signs at busy intersections, New York City is unique in that the default for all five boroughs is you can't make a right turn at a red traffic light (source 3).

---

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Why is NYC unique in having this 'no right turn on red traffic light' rule?

2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of by default not allowing right turns at red traffic lights throughout the five boroughs?

3: 42 U.S.C. § 6322(c) seems to codify the requirement for right turn on red traffic lights. Why does NYC get an exception?

The common belief that Trump has ties with Russia is the ""comrade"" relationship. A sort of 'let me build on boardwalk and I'll give you the railroads' type of thing. Becoming president seems like a stretch to accomplish that when you could just lobby like every other industry does but I digress.

The type of relationship trumps lawyer spoke of was a diplomatic relationship, like all world leaders have with each other and is not at all unusual. Obama had a diplomatic relationship with Russia.

116,5cct7i,False,None,109,Obama just moved to protect Planned Parenthood funding permanently through Title X; my question is what are the mechanisms of government by which the President can do that?,NeutralPolitics,"See here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-planned-parenthood_us_57d2c654e4b06a74c9f42f46

Obama apparently added a new rule to Title X that says that states cannot withhold federal family planning money for any reason other than the provider’s ""ability to deliver services to program beneficiaries in an effective manner.""

Wikipedia says Title X is a public law, but I'm not really sure what that entails. What does it mean for the President to add a new rule to a public law? Does anyone have to approve this? Articles I've read about it seem to imply that Congress and states will not have a say in it.

I'm simply looking for an explanation of the mechanisms of government involved in doing something like this, and specifically around the powers of the Executive branch as it relates to modifying laws.

I am not really looking for a discussion of the arguments for or against this specific change, but do as you will.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5cct7i/obama_just_moved_to_protect_planned_parenthood/,852,"> I'm simply looking for an explanation of the mechanisms of government involved in doing something like this, and specifically around the powers of the Executive branch as it relates to modifying laws.

What HHS is doing (probably spurred on by Obama) is making a change to federal regulations regarding Title X. You can find what governs the process in rulemaking [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf), but I'll provide a summary of the [Administrative Procedures Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States\)) here:

* 1) The agency has to have rulemaking authority delegated to it by Congress.
* 2) The agency has to publish the proposed rule for the public to view.
* 3) The public gets time to comment on the proposed rule
* 4) The agency has examine the public comments, but is not required to take them in account (I believe the agency also has to provide a substantive reply to every substantive comment, but I can't find the source for that right now).
* 5) The final rule is published for review but does not immediately go into effect until a certain date from when the final rule is published.

Conceivably, Donald Trump can get the rule changed again, but he'd need to follow the same process. HHS would submit a new proposed rule, it would receive public comments, the final rule would be proposed, and finally would be implemented.

My understanding is that rulemaking can take months or even years, so there's no guarantee that Obama can rush this through before Trump is sworn in. There's also no guarantee that Trump can undo it just as quickly- the HHS director is appointed to a term of service

Also, Congress is going to loom over PP funding next year. Congress might take away the ability for HHS to make this rule, or otherwise bar funding to Planned Parenthood which nullifies anything the Executive branch can do. 

That's the real drawback of Executive power as Obama has wielded it. What Obama has done can be un-done just as easily by Trump. And what Obama has done can be *permanently* undone if Congress passes a law removing the authority of executive agencies (see step #1 above).

Furthermore, rulemaking is subject to judicial challenge. If the process isn't followed properly, the courts can strike down the rule as not following the correct process. Additionally, if the executive branch does things that *should* be regulations the courts will often step in. The most prominent example of this is Obama's actions regarding immigration. What [stopped him in the courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Texas) was that the courts felt that parts of his action amounted to regulatory changes in which he did not go through the process as I described above.

Would this be an example of what happens if it is repealed? ""pastor joe can now say ""vote for Bush"" and can write a check from ""first baptist church"" to ""George Bush Campaign fund""?

Trump says that the purpose of the executive order is to end the practice of anchor babies: babies who are born on US soil to non-US citizens/illegal aliens but are US citizens because they were born inside the US. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_baby)

Opponents argue that the executive order would violate the Section 1 of 14th Amendment of the United States, which states that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

* /u/lolmonger: ""I tend to think of ""Neutral"" as meaning a position that has some kind of logical grounding and is communicated along with how the conclusion was made and acknowledges it isn't the final word, necessarily, and is open to new information changing it.""

* /u/lulfas: ""Perspective, sources, facts. I had a professor that said 'if you can't argue both sides of a topic, you don't know enough about it to speak in public'. I attempt to live that on NeutralPolitics.""

* /u/PavementBlues: ""The phrase that I use to briefly describe a neutral approach is that it is one in which we seek to find out whether our opinions are correct rather than prove that they are correct.""

Additionally, both the mod team and the userbase [have had discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/15d8fc/is_neutral_the_same_as_moderate/) on whether ""neutral means moderate"" and the answer has been a resounding ""no"".

The National Football League (NFL) recently issued [new rules regarding athlete behavior during the national anthem,](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy) specifically requiring present athletes to stand while it's being played, but allowing those who object to remain in the locker room until the anthem concludes. There are fines associated with violations of these rules.

Political protest is a [Constitutionally guaranteed right in the US,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) but many [legal experts support the view](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/25/16360580/nfl-donald-trump-national-anthem-protest) that the NFL, as a private organization, may set its own workplace rules, even if they limit expression. 

On the other hand, there are some interesting counterarguments.

> Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in *Beckman v. Chicago Bear Football Club* that a Green Bay Packers fan [may proceed with his First Amendment lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2018/05/02/recent-court-decision-makes-it-riskier-for-nfl-teams-to-punish-protesting-players/#354cee8948d8) against the Chicago Bears organization after the Bears refused to allow him to attend an on-field event while dressed in Packers clothing. The court noted that the fan may have a right to ""free speech"" within Soldier Field based on an operating agreement that gave both the Chicago Bears football club and the Chicago Park District shared control over speech in the **publicly-funded football stadium.** (emphasis added)

[Many NFL stadiums are publicly funded.](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-new-stadiums-public-funding-how-much-atlanta-san-diego-minnesota-los-angeles-033116)

And Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard professor of labor and industry, [calls the ban ""flatly illegal""](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/25/17394422/nfl-knee-kneeling-labor-law-kaepernick-free-speech-protest-owners) on a number of different grounds, including the league's failure to discuss the new rules with the player's union before changing the terms of employment, the restriction it imposes on the employees' right to engage in a collective action, and the limitations it introduces on protected free speech, based on either State constitutions, or Federally, because of the involvement of the US President in the dispute.

So, the first question is, based on the above, whether the NFL's new policy is legal.

Moving beyond that, is the ban an appropriate measure for the league to take? President Trump expressed his support for the rule and strongly implied that it didn't go far enough:

> I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or
you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.

Others argue that in the US, [the act of protest itself is patriotic.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-anthem-nfl-protest-patriotism-20180524-story.html) Is there room for dissent over policy at a public event put on by a private organization?

And finally, if the NFL's new policy isn't the right one, what would be better? Have alternative approaches been proposed that would allow the league to respond to the desires of its fans while also honoring the laws and traditions of the country?

>This analysis tests the often-made argument that immigrants do only jobs Americans don't want. If the argument is correct, there should be occupations comprised entirely or almost entirely of immigrants (legal and illegal). But Census Bureau data collected from 2009 to 2011, which allows for detailed analysis of all 472 separate occupations, shows that there were only a handful of majority-immigrant occupations. Thus, there really are no jobs that Americans won't do. Further, we estimated the share of occupations that are comprised of illegal immigrants, and found that there are no occupations in which the majority of workers are illegally in the country.

I have often heard the contention that immigrants do jobs Americans won't, but some articles, such as the aforementioned one quoted in the previous paragraph, say that this is largely a myth, similar to how the notion that ""immigrants *take* our jobs"" is [said by some](http://www.seiu.org/cards/the-8-worst-myths-about-immigration) to be a myth.

The pieces linked below, however, seem to show that, perhaps, there is some truth to the idea that Americans won't do certain jobs (although, these articles are generally specific to California and Georgia):

[California Crops Rot as Immigration Crackdown Creates Farmworker Shortage](http://fortune.com/2017/08/08/immigration-worker-shortage-rotting-crops/)

**Finally:**

Following the above, there are roughly two perspectives on this issue.

The wild card in this argument, based on the available evidence, is whether Americans are willing to do these jobs at the wages paid or offered, or at all.

Brad Goehring, a fourth-generation farmer, [tested](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/) the hypothesis of whether a higher agricultural wage would get Americans to do these jobs. Even that, at least in his case, was not wholly sufficient to accomplish such:

Basis for this question is that China is often condemned for it's lack of rights or abuses of such. However the authoritarian control they have means they can be quite effective for such a large country in implementing any changes such as environmental based policies or clamping down on corruption. Censorship and constant control can stifle knowledge and new ideas, however also help keep from having to deal with large internal conflict over how to progress or going back and forth in policies or trying to cater to public for votes.

You can read about our 100 cases here: https://conlaw.us/cases/


Ask me anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/dosecf/ask_me_anything_100_supreme_court_cases_everyone/,800,"No *Reynolds v. Sims*?  

In my humble opinion, this case in particular has caused great harm to the American Republic, and has gone a long ways into provoking animosity at the State and National Levels.

The framers of the US Constitution realized that State representation needed balance between big States and small ones, and was smart enough to build the Senate (even representation) and House (proportional representation) to separate powers and provide checks and balances.  This separation of powers coming from Montesquieu who saw what happened in pre-Revolutionary France.

Reynolds v. Sims effectively made it impossible for States to bridge their rural/urban divides along long-standing county lines.  In an ideal state, the counties would be represented by 2 Senators, and apportioned by population for the Lower House.  Instead, both Upper and Lower Houses are proportioned by population.

This ends up meaning in both hard-core RED and BLUE states that urban centers end up dictating a lot of State policy, creating animosity between cities and the surrounding areas.  

If we didn't have Harold v. Sims, state politics would be less one-sided, and would allow some level of competition across the rural-urban divide to achieve an agenda.  If the Democrats wanted to push a platform, they would need to make it applicable to the rural population and urban population at large.

It's a real tragedy honestly, rooted mainly in a poor decision by a 1960s activist court.  It's made the nation a lot worse off, and should another civil war happen, be one of the root causes.

-----------------------------------------------------

**Now for my question:** Do you feel that Reynolds V. Sims was a decision marred by a unilateral focus in civil rights?  It's my impression the Court was very myopic in deciding this on the humorous assumption that one man = one vote.  Do you also feel there was a way for this decision to maintain a separation of powers?  Perhaps ensuring more equal proportional representation in the lower house, but also ensuring the upper house couldn't restructure itself once set? ",2019-10-29 16:39:20

 The indictment charges that the named defendants used spearphishing emails to obtain passwords from various DNCC and campaign officials and then in some cased leveraged access gained from those passwords to attack servers, and that GRU malware persisted on DNC servers throughout most of the 2016 campaign.

148,8u152w,False,None,97,"What happens now with the ""Travel Ban""?",NeutralPolitics,"Today, [SCOTUS ruled 5-4 that the Trump has constitutional authority to implement his ""Travel Ban""](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf).

So my questions are pretty simple: What happens now?

If we read the text of the [current ""Travel Ban""](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/), which was issued in March of 2017, there are several key things I'd like to inquire about.

The first is the statement that such a travel ban will last only 90-days:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Does the 90-day period begin now, or how does that work? Also, is it enforced by law or is the 90-day window an arbitrary number that has no legal bearing?

Lastly, there are several mentions of stipulating factors for this proclamation, specifically surrounding our (The United States) ""review"" of several processes. Examples:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, **while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review**, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

> Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP **pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.** Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Since these statements, to me, imply that this ban will continue as long as our processes are under review, is there anything that legally obligates the government to conduct an actual review of their processes *and finish it*, or could they theoretically conduct a review for four years?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8u152w/what_happens_now_with_the_travel_ban/,787,"Should it not  be moot, since it should have expired 90 days after it was enacted so that ""we can figure out what the hell is going on?""

---

Highlights:

* The UK has voted to leave the EU, with voters in England outside of London being the bulk of the Leave vote.  Wales was very closely split with a slight lead for Leave.  Northern Ireland was also close with a slight lead for Remain.  Scotland was strongly for Remain.

* Global markets have been shocked by the news, and stocks are down markedly around the globe.  The British pound has had its single largest fall in at least the past four decades and is at levels not seen since 1985.

* The vote begins a negotiation period between the United Kingdom and the European Union over the terms of departure which may last up to two years.  The UK may seek to retain access to the common market, but it is not assured that can happen.

* Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to resign his office by October.  He had been a vocal proponent of ""Remain"" but had called the referendum based on a campaign promise to do so.

* There are substantial calls for Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland to consider referenda on leaving the United Kingdom.  Scotland recently voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 by about a 10 point margin in favour of staying in the UK.

&#x200B;

Without a quorum they cannot hold any votes, and their constitution mandates all bills not passed by June 30 to be considered dead. They would need to reintroduce any legislation and get it approved all over again.

In this particular example, it's extra spicy because at least one lawmaker seems to have insinuated they will kill those attempting to return them by force, and several militia groups have made [similar threats](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oregon-statehouse-shut-down-after-lawmakers-team-up-with-right-wing-militias/ar-AADh0mB?ocid=spartanntp).

This raises several questions for me:

* Are these walkouts legal? Could these lawmakers be charged even if they return voluntarily?
* As a follow-up to that: can these lawmakers be dismissed from their posts without a vote? If not, are there supposed to be any measures in place to prevent these actions? Seems like it would be very easy and very exploitable to just wait until shortly before this deadline every session and then just stage a walkout to deny the majority, especially if votes are required to remove you and those take time to arrange. What solutions have other states or democracies found to this kind of problem?

In regards to the threats:

* Who is normally responsible for returning these lawmakers to do their jobs?
* If threats are escalated or violence is begun, is this considered a purely domestic matter to Oregon and their police are the ones to resolve, or could the National Guard or federal armed forces become involved? I suppose the FBI is also possible since some of them appear to have crossed state lines.

So therefore, (not that any real evidence was presented against The President) but Nothing the Minority Report states is subject to any real-world evidentiary standards or legal checks-and-balances. 

Having said that, the below subjects are also up to factual dispute: 

**1) The purpose of President Trumps interaction with the Ukrainian President.** 

The [Majority's report](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191203_-_full_report___hpsci_impeachment_inquiry_-_20191203.pdf) states a number of vague and pointless statements, albeit nefarious sounding, regarding the President's intent. 

>The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort **by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report thatfollows, President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.** The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditionedtwo official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Entirely disregarding the President's stated purpose of investigating Joe Biden and his Son's actions in the Ukraine in an apparent attempt to get attention off him attempting to investigate illegal actions of the Bidens and onto ""the attempt"" to investigate. Actions of which [Joe Biden admitted to on video](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/27/flashback_2018_joe_biden_brags_at_cfr_meeting_about_withholding_aid_to_ukraine_to_force_firing_of_prosecutor.html). 

All while ignoring the extreme hypocrisy that accusing the president of ""attempting to influence the 2020 election"" is 1] not only implying that anyone in a political position to even ""potentially"" run for president is immune from investigation but 2] Exactly what their self-stated ""Political"" investigation of the president is doing Literally the same thing they are accusing the president of.  

**2) The accusation the President pressured the Ukrainian President to investigate or he'd withhold aid.** 

You know, that nefarious phrase suddenly used so constantly.

 Russian Collu.. I mean ""Quid Pro Quo"". Sounds scary huh? Well it literally just means ""something for something"". 

Well, the Ukrainian President [debunked those lies](https://time.com/5686305/zelensky-ukraine-denies-trump-pressure/) from the very beginning. 

>“I think you read everything. I think you read text,” Zelensky said to the gathered reporters on Wednesday. “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections of U.S.A. No, you heard that we had good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me.”


But all in all, the public already knows what this is. **Another** act in political theatre. Bringing to mind all the past, similar events like ""Russian Collusion"", ""Kavanaugh"", ""Porn-stars"", out of context ""both sides"" quotes, ""taxes"", ""kids in cages"" and locker-room recordings. 

Nothing substantial will come of this in terms of negative for The President. ",2019-12-04 14:34:37
159,f2emhs,False,None,179,Do the changing sentencing positions of the US government in the Roger Stone case constitute a violation of US law or DoJ policy?,NeutralPolitics,"Yesterday the Department of Justice filed a [sentencing memorandum](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.279.0_2.pdf) for Roger Stone, who had provided information from WikiLeaks to the Trump campaign during 2016.  Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.

In that sentencing memorandum, the DoJ sought a sentence within the range they calculated the US Sentencing Guidelines to suggest of 87 to 108 months (7-9 years).

Stone's attorneys [disputed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.280.0.pdf) the guidelines calculation made by the government, and believe the guidelines range should be 15-21 months imprisonment.  They also requested a downward departure from that range, seeking only probation without incarceration.

After the sentencing memorandum from the government was filed, President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585) 

>""This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!""  

>>@ChuckRossDC  ""Prosecutors recommend up to NINE YEARS in prison for Roger Stone. They call foreign election interference a ""deadly adversary"" even though Stone was never accused of working with Russians or WikiLeaks.""

After the President's tweet, news broke that the Department of Justice intended to file a second sentencing memorandum, [overriding the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing memorandum.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-stone/in-reversal-justice-department-to-seek-shorter-sentence-for-trump-adviser-stone-idUSKBN2052E5)

After that news breaking, one of the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing brief [gave notice to the court that he was no longer working on the case, and had resigned as a special assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia.](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.282.0_5.pdf)  A second prosecutor also [resigned as an Assistant US Attorney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.283.0_3.pdf) shortly thereafter.

**Edit for subsequent developments.**  The DoJ has filed a [""supplemental and amended""](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.286.0_5.pdf) sentencing memorandum, signed by John Crabb, Jr, who was not one of the attorneys previously on the case.  The supplemental memorandum says:

>The prior filing submitted by the United States on February 10, 2020 (Gov. Sent. Memo.
ECF No. 279) does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice’s position on what would be
a reasonable sentence in this matter. While it remains the position of the United States that a
sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of
87 to 108 months presented as the applicable advisory Guidelines range would not be appropriate
or serve the interests of justice in this case

My questions are:

1.  If the DoJ changed its position due to the President's tweet, or other pressure from the President, is that lawful?  Does it make a difference that the conduct Stone lied about related to the President's campaign?

2.  Is it in compliance with DoJ guidelines for attorneys, or the rules of professional ethics?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/f2emhs/do_the_changing_sentencing_positions_of_the_us/,760,[removed] ,2020-02-11 20:41:18

> “Unwilling to cope with the results of last November’s election, the Legislature introduced this unconstitutional bill as a form of therapy to deal with their disbelief at the 2016 election results, and to play politics to their base.""

Sponsor of the current iteration of this legislation in New Jersey, State Senator Loretta Weinberg, defends the measure, saying (from 3rd source): 

> “It is so obvious with this president that had voters known some of what seem to be his business interests, he may not have been elected president.""

Supporters of the bill may have a constitutional argument (from 3rd source):

> Supporters say states have room under the U.S. Constitution to create ballot access requirements and argue that voters should be able to review candidates’ tax returns in deciding who to send to the White House.

I have three questions on this topic:

1: Do any States currently have unique requirements that must be met to be listed on the State ballot in a Presidential election?

2: Specifically to tax returns; can states force a candidate to disclose this information or take them off the State ballot?

3: Are there clear limits for what information States can require of Presidential candidates to include them on their ballots?

For those who are confused, the Constitution splits up power between three branches of government.  The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  Each one has *enumerated* powers, meaning powers explicitly written into the Constitution for that branch to exercise.  In theory, this would help stop the concentration of power into one branch.  However, overtime, Congress has delegated powers to the Executive branch (as well as to its independent agencies) to carry out laws created by the Legislative branch; these powers are sometimes referred to as apart of the ""Administrative State"".

The megathread format we most often used, some introductory questions and then a live tick-tock works great for election nights, but not as well for debates and speeches.  So we're gonna try something new.

The way it will work is as follows:

* **All top level comments will be posted by mods.**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate.  Obviously this will be live so there may be errors.  But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

* **Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.**

All fact checks **must** contain a link to a source stating what the true thing is, and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms what the candidate said.  Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.

* **Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments**

Delaware public records do not disclose the management of DTTM Operations LLC, though they do show that Trump's sons and Weisselberg served as directors of a related company.

This has also been reported [here](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-donald-trump-trust-20170204-story.html) and in the NYT article in #3 below. 

It appears that Trump's trust is

1. Revocable

2. Administered by his son and Trump executive officer who will provide ""reports on any profit, or loss, on his company as a whole""

3. [The purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the 'exclusive benefit' of the president](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html)

In April of this year, the FCC [proposed to reverse](https://www.fcc.gov/document/restoring-internet-freedom) the Title II categorization of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that was enacted in 2015:

> The Commission's 2015 decision to subject ISPs to Title II utility-style regulations risks that innovation, serving ultimately to threaten the open Internet it purported to preserve.

> The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)has proposed a *Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)* to end the utility-style regulatory approach that gives government control of the Internet and to restore the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to reverse the decline in infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for consumers put into motion by the FCC in 2015. To determine how to best honor our commitment to restoring Internet Freedom, the NPRM also evaluates the existing rules governing Internet service providers' practices.


When the 2015 rules were passed, FCC commissioner Ajit Pai (now chairman) issued a [dissenting statement:](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf)

> ...reclassifying broadband, applying the bulk of Title II rules, and half-heartedly forbearing from the rest ""for now"" will drive smaller competitors out of business and leave the rest in regulatory vassalage

and

> ...the Order ominously claims that ""[t]hreats to Internet openness remain today,"" that broadband providers ""hold all the tools necessary to deceive consumers, degrade content or disfavor the content that they don’t like,"" and that the FCC continues ""to hear concerns about other broadband provider practices involving blocking or degrading third-party applications.""

> The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it’s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria.


It is [widely believed](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/ajit-pai-announces-plan-to-eliminate-title-ii-net-neutrality-rules/) that reversing the Title II categorization would spell the end for [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) rules.

So, the question is, **why should we keep or reverse Net Neutrality rules?**

This sub requires posts be neutrally framed, so this one asks about both sides of the issue. However, reddit's audience skews heavily towards folks who already understand the arguments in favor of Net Neutrality, so all the submissions we've gotten today on this topic have asked about the arguments *against* it. If you can make a good, well-sourced summary of the arguments for eliminating Net Neutrality rules, it would probably help a lot of people to better understand the issue.

180,7q4gmx,False,None,218,Is there a significant sentencing disparity between black people and white people in the US that isn't otherwise explained by the difference in crime rates?,NeutralPolitics,"There seems to be a lot of contradictory evidence on this question.  In pursuit of objectivity I'd like to pose it to /r/neutralpolitics.

On the side of ""there is no sentencing disparity"", I found an article [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/4847/6-leftist-myths-about-criminal-justice-system-get-ben-shapiro) that makes the following claims:

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Overprosecute Blacks.** For literally decades, studies have demonstrated that there is statistical parity between crime reports and arrests. Unless witnesses in the black community – predominantly the victims of black crime – are somehow racist against blacks, cops are arresting people who are guilty of crimes.

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Sentence Blacks Disproportionately Longer.**...studies have actually shown a slightly lower chance of prosecution and slightly lower sentences for black convicts...“A 1994 Justice Department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution following a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. Following conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however – an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records.”

I couldn't find a source for ""there is parity between crime reports and crime rates"", but if that is true it seems to lend itself to the conclusion being that the higher arrest rate of blacks is due to their higher crime rate, rather than due to prejudice on the part of police officers.  While a counterargument might be that the crime reports are disproportionately done by white members of majority black communities, or by white police officers, this also doesn't take into account the fact that black members of the community or black police officers may also have a bias against black people in that regard, and that this implicitly assumes from the start that white officers and community members have this bias.

I did find [the source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc94.pdf) for the second claim, but I couldn't validate the ""and outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records"" claim.  I couldn't find much information on this one reading the report, but a number of other sources mention this report so I'm inclined to believe it's true.  However I'd like more information.

On the other side, I have [this slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) which makes a few other claims.

>**Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.**

It gives [this source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/?utm_term=.783daadc09c6).  The counterargument is that black people simply speed more than white people.  I couldn't find evidence for this however, but I'm not sure this is certain evidence of racial bias among police officers.

>**Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than white Americans for the same offense.**

[It uses this source](http://c-6rtwjumjzx7877x24jhtstrnhx78x2ezghx2ehf.g00.slate.com/g00/3_c-6bbb.x78qfyj.htr_/c-6RTWJUMJZX77x24myyux78x3ax2fx2fjhtstrnhx78.zgh.hfx2fknqjx78x2f7568x2f50x2fuik_ufujw_rfwny-wjmfan-wfhnfq-inx78ufwnyd-kjijwfq-hwnrnsfq.uik_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1).  It's quite long, and I'm not sure if it takes into account prior convictions, which is a potential counterargument.  Furthermore it seems to contradict the second piece of evidence on the other side.  This is the big piece of evidence that I'm confused about, and am not sure which side to believe.

Both of these articles are biased in some way, but I think taking these 2 claims from each of them provides a good starting point for the conversation.  Is there a disparity in sentencing, incarceration, policing, arrests, etc between blacks and whites that can't otherwise be explained by the difference in crime rates?  Does racial prejudice factor into it?

186,fd2zz4,False,Megathread,414,NeutralPolitics Super Tuesday Megathread,NeutralPolitics,"Welcome to the biggest night of the primary season: Super Tuesday.  Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa^1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.^2

* **How are the delegates are awarded?**

 The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)

 States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.  

* **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**

 [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.  

 Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.  As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.

* **When will we know results?**

 It will vary, with the first polls closing at [7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161503/super-tuesday-voting-polls-results-what-time)

 However, some results may take quite a while.  California especially is both the biggest haul today, and [famously slow](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/809941998/on-super-tuesday-dont-expect-quick-election-results-from-the-west) in counting ballots.  Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.

* **Who is gonna win?**

 Who do I look like, Nate Silver?

I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.

Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:

Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?

**7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.

**7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else. 

**7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.

**7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.

**7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.

**8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.

**8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden. 

**8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.

**8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.

**8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.

**8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.

Bloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.

**8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.

**9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.

**9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.

**9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.

**9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.

**9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.

**9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)

**9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)

* Biden: Gonna make it everywhere
* Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else.
* Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO.
* Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.

None of these include California because polls are still open there.

**9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will [""reassess""](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.

**9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.

**10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.

**10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.

**10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.

**10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.

**10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.

**11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.

**11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.

**11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.

**11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.

**11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.  

Legend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.

* Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA

* Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*

**11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.

**11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.

**12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.

**12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big ""if"").

**12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.

**12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.

As a corollary, roughly half of U.S. consumers  don’t even have one  month’s savings, and couldn’t handle a single emergency, like an  unexpected transmission repair (or a partial government shutdown) ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28)).

Mueller was [appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html).

But is that really where the influence ends? Who decides how much budget he has? Can Rosenstein or anyone else influence the investigation by limiting the budget or vetoing staff hires? Or by other means like imposing an unrealistic timeline? 

How often and to whom does he have to report to make sure he's using the funds appropriately and is this an area for potential influence?

Does such a line of reporting and oversight mean someone like Rosenstein is actually privy to what Mueller has found so far and what he's planning?

Ultimately what's the effect on the independence of the investigation?

Edit: The practical questions are answered in the comments. The question remains as to how much influence this permits. Theoretically it's a lot, and it's not clear how Rosenstein's decision making can be challenged. Sessions can't, Trump won't.

The difference between 'testing' and 'tampering' is important. *Witness tampering* is a crime under [18 U.S. Code § 1512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512).

However, as the Nancy Pelosi mentions and the [New York Times explains](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony.html), Gaetz might be protected under the 'speech and debate' clause:

1: Does the tweet alone by Gaetz constitute witness tampering?

2: How does Gaetz's special status as a member of Congress under the 'speech and debate' clause affect such a charge?

**Liberal minority projected**

Happy election day!

Today is election day in Canada, with voters going to the polls to elect 338 members of Parliament across the country.  Each member is elected in a first past the post election from a single district called a ""riding.""^1

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering ""Does Canada really span 6 time zones?"" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)


[Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)  

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)

As the night goes on, I may refer back to that piece in discussing government formation and minority or coalition government scenarios.

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

**4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

* As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

* There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

* If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

* If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

* If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

* If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

* If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.  

 * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

 * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

**6:35 PM EDT** Added some live stream links up top.

**7:00 PM EDT** Polls are now closed in Newfoundland and Labrador.

**7:20 PM EDT**  Liberals leading in 3 ridings that have results so far - all ridings they are expected to win.

**7:30 PM EDT** Polls closed in the maritime provinces now.  Will have a 2 hour wait from now until we get the big poll closing for QC/ON/MB/SK/AB/Territories.

**7:44 PM EDT Lib:2** Two seats called in Newfoundland for the Liberals, in seats they were pretty comfortably expected to hold.  Conservatives not leading in many seats but seem to be improving on 2015 in raw vote counts so far.

**8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

**8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

**8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

**8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now. 

**9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

**9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.  Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power.  They are now leading in the Gaspe seat.  This will be a long night.

**9:30 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 3; NDP 1**  Okay, here we go!  Big poll close time.

**9:40 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 4; NDP 1** I'm only saying called seats, but Liberals are leading in a lot of spots.  Bloc not getting too many leads.  Bernier of the People's Party looks to be getting his seat. 

**9:44 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1**  One GTA suburbs seat with meaningful vote in, going well for the Liberals.  If they perform like this in the rest of the Toronto area, Justin Trudeau will have a very good night.

**9:47 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** And now they're behind in that seat... so things are swinging a lot.  Bernier is also now behind in his seat.

**9:53 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Bloc and Liberals are cutting up Quebec between them, which is pretty good for the Liberals, and a (mostly expected) disaster for the NDP.

**9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.

**10:00 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Polls are now closed across Canada.

**10:05 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Liberals are leading in a lot of GTA seats, seems like all of the seats in Mississauga and Brampton so far are red, as well as the center Toronto seats.  Couple of seats up by Vaughan with a Conservative lead.

**10:10 PM EDT**  **CBC is projecting a Liberal government** (though probably more fair to say Liberal plurality).

**10:15 PM EDT Lib 23; Con 8; NDP 1**  Based on leads, Liberals are losing about net 20 seats, and probably on track to lose some more which would put them into minority government territory.

**10:23 PM EDT  Lib 26; Con 19; BQ 2; NDP 1**  Liberal minority government projected, big question will be whether Liberal+NDP will make it to 170.  Right now they are just at that line with leading + elected.  150 Liberal leading+elected, 20 NDP leading+ elected.

**10:39 PM EDT Lib 52; Con 58; BQ 10; NDP 1** Despite Conservative lead in locked-up seats, Liberals still leading in plenty more.  Looks like all the party leaders on track to hold their seats.

**10:50 PM EDT Lib 77; Con 73; BQ 18; NDP 2** I was mistaken about all the leaders keeping their seats.  Bernier is defeated, and the PPC is getting very little traction.  Trudeau and Scheer have won their seats.  May is leading in her seat, as is Singh (though Singh is only up by a few percent).

**11:02 PM EDT Lib 100; Con 85; BQ 22; NDP 6; Grn 1** Interestingly, the Liberals are likely to be in government despite getting less popular vote than the Conservatives, though extremely close right now.  33.8% Liberal, 33.9% Conservative.  Definitely the Liberals are seeing big vote efficiency advantages, with Alberta especially having some huge blowout ridings where the Conservatives do not get much of any advantage by winning by 50+%.

**11:15 PM EDT Lib 110; Con 95; BQ 25; NDP 9; Grn 1**  Looks like based on leading+elected that the Liberals would only need the support of one of the NDP or Bloc to have a working majority, so that gives them several paths to keeping confidence of the Commons (seems by far most likely they'd do that through the NDP).

**11:24 PM EDT Lib 114; Con 97; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2** Greens look to be getting about 4 seats tonight, which would be by far their best haul ever.  

We also are looking at a pretty definite popular vote / seat count split, with the Liberals now 0.6% behind the Conservatives in raw vote, but far ahead in seat count.

**11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.

**11:40 PM EDT  Lib 120; Con 106; BQ 26; NDP 11; Grn 2**  Going to end the tick tock here.  Results of the night seem pretty clear.  Biggest remaining question seems to be whether Scheer remains conservative leader.

[The 2nd Circuit ruled that Trump cannot block critics on Twitter.](https://reason.com/2019/07/09/2nd-circuit-agrees-that-trump-cannot-constitutionally-block-critics-on-twitter) The sub headline reads:

**Obama could have accomplished more, if not for the *unprecedented obstruction* by Republicans**

Examples:

https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/01/11/grownup-leaving-building/

>There's not enough space in this column to list all the many ways the GOP obstructed Obama.

>Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power

http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/09/opinions/obama-legacy-opinion-roundup/

Elizabeth Warren even went so far as to argue that obstructionism “has created a breeding ground for new and dangerous Republican extremism” that “encourage[s] even more outrageous behavior from other Republican leaders” and “is on display in the 2016 election.” More specifically, she claimed that Republicans “have consistently blocked President Obama’s judicial nominees.”

http://newbostonpost.com/2016/06/06/warren-faults-senate-gop-for-fostering-trump-extremism/

Jesse Jackson:

>He did all of this while facing unprecedented, unrelenting partisan obstruction, with the Republican leader of the Senate opposing him at every turn, intent on making him a one-term president. In part because of that opposition, much remained undone. The stimulus would have been larger and the recovery stronger except for Republican opposition. The national minimum wage would have been raised. A national infrastructure project to rebuild America would have been launched. Progress on making America the leader of the green revolution, the next global industrial revolution, would have been greater. Guantanamo, the shameful prison in Cuba, would have been closed. The Voting Rights Act would have been revived, and much more.

Some even specifically blamed 'white men':

>And it is clear that he has been obstructed at every turn by white men on the right who have offered temper tantrums instead of leadership. But it is also clear that the president could have done more.

Even Bill Clinton used the phrase:

>After President Obama was elected, Republicans made it their number one goal to block him at every turn,"" spokesman Angel Urena said in a statement. ""That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obama's success so we can all grow and succeed together.""

Some other mentions of the phrase I have found either vaguely referencing how it prevented his legacy, or how it's unique to the GOP (""GOP-style""), use it to explain why he 'hasn't accomplished much' etc.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/eight-was-enough.html

>For others, the culprit is the Republican Party, which obstructed Mr. Obama at every turn. And for still others, like Mr. Obama, the problem is that his administration didn’t do enough to advertise its greatness. Even if you believe there are elements of truth in these explanations, they still amount to excuses.

Or have even argued that obstruction made him *more* powerful: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/barack-obama-gop-most-powerful-213814


**Was Obama obstructed, and if yes**:

**a)** was this to an *historically unprecedented* degree, and if not unprecedented: is this unique to *Republican* lawmakers or have Democrats done the same thing in the past?

**b)** What -specific-  parts of Obama's agenda have not been accomplished could reasonably be blamed on *Republican obstruction*?

To Whom Is This Spending Going?,NeutralPolitics,"[Twice as much per capita.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) And spending, even for goods, ultimately is for labor so incomes/employment should be able to tell you the whole picture of spending.  So who are the workers - medical professionals, technology suppliers, insurers, government, researchers, etc. - that the US has more of or spends more on? Are providers/administrators getting paid more or are there more of them?  And for every one of these that does not account for twice as much per capita spending, the others must cost *over* twice as much to explain difference, right?

1. *Are doctor's just charging more?*:  [Looks like](https://journal.practicelink.com/vital-stats/physician-compensation-worldwide/), doctors in the US charge about 50% more than European doctors.

2. *Are there more total workers*  I suspect this is a major cause but its hard to get numbers .  [I see](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx) that the NHS in England employs 1.5 million people to cover a population of 54 million people. And [this site](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2009/health_care/) says about 11% of workers in the US are employed in private healthcare.  I can't find any direct comparison of number of public workers in other countries vs private workers in the US.

3. *Is the US providing more healthcare?* [We can look at quality...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare) the US does have a better survival rate for cancer and heart disease.  But the life expectancy [isn't better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy).  Does this imply the US *does not* spend more for end-of-life care?  [This](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2016/january/cost-of-endoflife-care-in-the) says the US spends about 20% more than Belgium, England and Netherlands, but 20% less than Canada and Norway.  I can't find anything else conclusive so I don't know about this answer.  There are also fewer hospital beds per capita [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) and fewer doctors per capita [(link)](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people) than many other countries.  [This very good article](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective) says the US does use more technology and drugs, but I can't tell how much of a cost this is.

4. *Does the US spend more on medical research?*  [This](https://www.quora.com/What-countries-have-lead-the-world-in-medical-research-and-innovation-in-the-past-20-years) seems to be a well researched answer but isn't per capita.  [This map](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search/map) shows total clinic trials.  Europe has 740 million people so I get 1 trial per 11,000 people in Europe and 1 trial per 3500 people in the US.

5. (EDIT) *Administrative costs*  I meant for this to be included in 2 but I think I didn't look into this enough.  I'm seeing numbers that are more than double now that I'm looking at it more.  While [the NHS in England spends 14%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/30/nhs-management-costs-spending) on administrative costs, looks like the US spends 30%: [link](http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/).  The discrepancy with Canada (in 1999) is even larger: [link](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa022033#t=article).

> Mr. Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code — Section 6103 — that allows Congress’s tax-writing committees to view tax information on any filer. 

The provision is regularly used to sample filers to measure the impact of tax policy, and is sometimes used for investigative purposes too, however using it to seek the tax returns of the President without his or her consent has little* precedent. 

(Edit: Originally stated ""No precedent."" This is a transcription error. The NYTime's states ""little precedent"". /u/Adama0001 has more information on similar precedent.)

---

The President's personal lawyers have submitted a letter to Department of the Treasury asking the IRS to deny the request on the grounds that the Democrats don't have a suitable reason to seek the returns, and that the President's personal returns should be protected like any private citizen.

The request through 26 U.S. Code § 6103 leaves little wiggle room for the Treasury, specifically (from the 1st source):

> (f) Disclosure to Committees of Congress

> > (1) *Committee on Ways and Means, Committee on Finance, and Joint Committee on Taxation*

> > Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request, except that any return or return information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure.

---

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Can the Treasury Secretary tell the IRS to deny the request, or is the code so clear the IRS must just produce the returns? 

2: If the Treasury Secretary can deny the request, must he provide a legally scrutinized justification for the denial? (Will his reasoning be the legal justification in court, or can he give a political answer?)

3: If the request for the tax returns are denied, what is the legal framing for this battle? For example, does this end up in the courts because Democrats subpoena the information, or does the codified nature of their request mean there's some non-subpoena way of resolving this issue?

It's not exactly clear what ""successes"" means when your customers are the citizens, but I think this gives some insight into the administration's thinking on the matter.

[This opinion piece](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2011/09/14/5-reasons-the-government-should-be-run-like-a-business) says running a country like a business means you do five things: balance the budget, restrict the money supply to control inflation, lay off non-productive workers, rework the benefit plans to maximize economic advantage, and discard poorly performing units (i.e., the Post Office).

The intro blurb to [this podcast](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/01/24/business/can-government-be-run-business) says making government run like a business means ""walking away from negotiations, always getting the best deal, and negotiating the lowest possible costs.""

[Singapore is a country that is said to be run like a business.](http://fortune.com/2015/03/23/singapore-leekuanyew-corporation-1974/) It achieved explosive growth of GDP and living standards under such an approach in the decades after independence.

If Boris Johnson is to win, he will be able to get Brexit deal done by the 31st.

There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.

Current [FT polling](https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17) has the Conservatives at 43%, Labour at 33%. However, with the First Past the Post electoral system, it is hard to know how this will translate into actual seats.

Whatever happens, it will be monumental and set the UK on its course for the next five years - and perhaps even more if the issue of Brexit can be resolved.

Scotland would want a 2nd Independence Referendum, and claimed this election would give them a mandate to have one, however the Conservatives have put any notion of one away.

**22:42:** The Guardian are reporting that the exit polls suggest that Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson is set to lose her seat in East Dumbartonshire, Scotland.

**22:46:** [The Pound has climbed against the Dollar](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-pound-wins-as-exit-poll-predicts-big-tory-majority-11884813) and the Euro by almost as much as 5 cents as the exit polls came in, citing stability in the UK political climate and a clearer future. This may also harm the attack that many Remainers used that leaving the EU would harm the UK economy.

**23:17:** Labour's heartlands in the Midlands - the so called Red Wall - is apparently swinging hard to the Conservatives, which is where many of these gains are likely to come from.

**23:26** The traditional race to get the first results are in from Newcastle Central. The results are Con: 9,290  Lab: 21,568 Lib: 2709 Green: 1,365 BXP: 2542. This seat was a Leave voting seat, but the Labour candidate was re-elected by a majority of over 12,000, but this is a 7% loss from 2017.

**23:34** In Sunderland South, Labour lost [18% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000754), and Blyth swung from Labour to Tory after they lost [15% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000575). These are all traditional Labour seats - and many were narrow vote Leave seats.

**00:32**[ Swindon North hold for Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000851). Doubled Labour's vote. Labour are down 8% here.

**01:03** A Labour seat that they won by over 10k votes in 2017 has [gone to a recount](https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1205289992840458241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205289992840458241&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This does not look good for the Labour Party.

**01:40** So far, Conservatives have gained 3 seats, SNP gained 1 seat, and Labour have lost 4 seats. We have only just begun. However, if these numbers are to be believed, the Exit Poll seems to be more or less accurate.

**02:03:** The first Labour gain has come in from Putney. The gain [has given Labour a 6% lead](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205304811979182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205304811979182080&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This is a London seat and was expected to swing to Labour.

**02:32:** Results so far - 52 Conservatives, 47 Labour, 7 Scottish Nationalists, 1 Liberal Democrats, 5 ""OTHERS"".

**02:46:** Results so far - 78 Con, 68 Lab, 13 SNP, 1 Lib Dem, 5 ""Others""

Currently, Labour has lost, on average, a share of votes of around 10%. This is almost historic. Most swings are between 2-4%. Tony Blair only surpassed this with a 15% swing in favour in 1998

**02:58** Chuka Unama, a former Conservative who joined the Liberal Democrats, [has lost his seat to the Conservaitves.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000639) This comes after both Labour and Liberal Democrats - a self proclaimed Remain alliance - ended up splitting the vote. If they voted tactically, they would have won by more than 6k votes.

**03:09:** DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, has lost [his seat to Sinn Fein](https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-12-13/live-counting-underway-at-centres-across-ni/)

**03:19:** Liberal Democrats [gained a Conservative seat, the first of the night](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205325042067935232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205325042067935232&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**03:35** It is expected that Jeremy Corbyn is going to stand down after this election, after stating that he ""will not lead the Labour Party into another General Election""

**03:52** Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has lost [her seat to the SNP by just over 100 seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123). It will be expected for her to resign, and a new leader to be elected - the fourth in the past 2 years.

266,chq9tj,False,None,210,"How can a former US President be indicted, arrested, and prosecuted?",NeutralPolitics,"Yesterday in the Congressional testimony of Robert Mueller, the former Special Counsel repeatedly said that the his office was not empowered to determine whether the president obstructed justice because of Department of Justice policy that the Department cannot indict the current president. However, [Mueller said that the president can be indicted after leaving office](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-donald-trump-can-charged-after-leaving-office/1814190001/). And in detailed questioning, [Mueller agreed that all of the three requirements for obstruction charges were met](https://news.yahoo.com/mueller-edges-closer-to-saying-trump-committed-obstruction-160919062.html). Beyond the Mueller case, the president's  former personal lawyer [is currently in prison for crimes that he says the president directed him to commit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/michael-cohen-gma-interview-trump/2309268002/), and [new evidence supports the president's involvement in those crimes](https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-says-trump-directed-142437206.html). So it seems very likely that a prosecutor could pursue an indictment of the president if not for the DOJ policy, and that policy is valid only as long as the president remains in office. What procedures take effect after that?

In particular,

* How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?
* [Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-secret-service-lifetime-protection-bush/1823961/); can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?
* If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?
* [The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-2020-win-could-run-out-clock-on-obstruction) If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statute of limitations is suspended (""tolled"") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?
* Before he was [pardoned by his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon), did prosecutors make these kinds of plans to indict former president Richard Nixon?
* What influence does the new president have over the possible prosecution of his or her predecessor? As we enter a new election cycle, have any candidates expressed a position on this?

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

At this subreddit, we want to allow people who disagree on something to work it out between themselves in the interest of mutual understanding. If understanding truly cannot be reached (which is sometimes the case), we recommend that the conversation only continue as long both sides maintain decorum and feel that they are benefiting from the interaction. The mods will allow you to debate as long as it is civil, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally, try your best in a conversation to understand the other person’s perspective and determine rationally whether it makes sense. Take time to consider what they are saying. **Do not read a reply with the assumption that the other person is wrong**. Look for points that make sense and acknowledge them. Look for points that you can disprove and lay out your counterargument and evidence. Through this attitude, your discussion can be constructive and informative for both parties involved.

-----

**So you’re personally not politically neutral? Well…can I still make Futurama jokes?**

I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

-----

**Are world events allowed, or is r/NeutralPolitics region specific?**

Our subreddit has a global scope, and the politics of any region is equally valued for conversation. Keep in mind, though, that if not many other redditors are located in the region that you are posting about, we won’t necessarily understand your topic. If that’s the case, make sure to post informative links so that we could all get a chance to learn more and then discuss it. 

-----

**I want to post a news article that I saw on a larger subreddit. Is that okay?**

Conversations on the larger political subreddits can often be disappointing, so it is perfectly acceptable to repost a news article here. In fact, it is encouraged! The goal is for r/NeutralPolitics to be a legitimate alternative to other political discussion subreddits, and that means that we need more than just discussion - we need current events, too. Just remember two things: use a different source for the story if the linked content is heavily biased or overly emotional and avoid copying the post title unless you have verified that it meets our standards.  Also we ask that you remove the references to the other subreddit, we don't really need a meta discussion about the other sub in question. 

-----

**There sure is a lot of weight placed on evidence and information here. Why is that?**

When discussing practical political issues, it is easy to get involved in emotional arguments and assumptions. By emphasizing that your argument is only as good as the data and/or logic that supports it, we remove the emotional element that leads to bickering and flame wars. It is much easier to argue information than it is to argue feelings, and we walk away from the former not angry, but with a better understanding of the world around us. **The goal here isn’t to prove that you are right.** It is to find out if you are right. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t defend your position, but it does mean that you should acknowledge when you have been presented with enough logical evidence to bring that position into question.

-----

**What kind of evidence should I use?**

We also have created a [guide to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qe3vg/a_resource_guide_for_building_your_factbased/).

-----

**What types of posts should I report?**

Most people associate the report button with someone breaking a rule. However, at r/NeutralPolitics we encourage that you report a post if there is any reason at all that a moderator should look at it. We won’t be able to necessarily catch everything, so we need your help to keep the standards of discussion for the community high. In addition to anything that breaks the /r/NeutralPoilitics & Reddit wide rules, report a post if it:

* Contains memes, spam, or is otherwise devoid of meaningful content
* Insults another user or says something that makes a hostile environment for discussion
* Doesn’t break any rules, but could use some constructive input 
* Cites a source that you think should be saved for posterity in the r/NeutralPolitics archive

Please don't report the following:

* You feel the comment isn't Neutral, note this isn't a requirement as long as the comment has sources for facts presented
* You feel the sources are biased, the answer to this is to respond with better sources, or with sources showing why that source can't be trusted. [Here is a good example](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5uv7ov/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_us_building_a/ddy0lt1/)

-----

**I’m an expert in a field relevant to this community, such as political science, economics, or statistics. Can I get flair?**

We don't give flair because we find it places an undue emphasis on the 'expert'.  It should be easier for any expert on a subject to find relevant sources and link or reference them.  

-----

**What do I do if I have a problem with a moderator?**

If a moderator is behaving inappropriately, [contact the mod team at large](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) privately with your concerns and one of us/all of us will be happy to discuss it with you.

**Surveys/Questions on Demographics/Breakdown by Party Affiliation**

We sometimes get requests to present data on the demographics of this sub, or someone saying they can't accurately gauge the ideas presented without some sort of demographic breakdown.  We do not do surveys, they are explicitly disallowed by our guidelines.  Again the qualifications for a good comment/post are: *""We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic.

When reading this over, nothing really concrete stood out to me that this EO was really accomplishing. Maybe I missed some of the nuance or how this EO will play with existing laws?

Section 2 says this: ""In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury""
Maybe I'm getting lost on the long sentence structure, but it sounds like it's saying the DoT will not take adverse action against religious organizations when they talk about politics where that speech is not ordinarily treated as political campaigning. But it also says consistent with law. So what does that really mean? Isn't it already against the law for religious organizations to use funds to campaign? So what does this section really change?

Section 3 (Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate) seemed the most concrete, but the language is written as ""shall consider"" - meaning that they don't have to implement anything from this EO. 

Section 4 just seems to be ""hey guys remember the first amendment when looking at laws, kthx""

280,5m7kmm,False,None,465,The ACA/Obamacare and the GOP's alternatives,NeutralPolitics,"With the senate voting yesterday to introduce a resolution that could begin the repeal of the ACA, it'd be good to discuss the benefits, costs, and effectiveness of the ACA as compared to alternative proposals, while recognizing the GOP has not formally coalesced around one single plan. 

The [ACA](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/) was created to control healthcare costs by expanding insurance coverage (through Medicaid expansion and the individual mandate + insurance marketplace), and to tie healthcare costs to patient outcomes by changing how Medicare pays doctors. 

Its [provisions include](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/): limits on age rating, pre-existing condition protection, staying on parents' policies up to age 26, cost-sharing subsidies, and contraceptive coverage. Congress can repeal the following provisions through budget reconciliation: medicaid expansion, premium subsidies, and the employer and individual mandates. This is where most Congressional Republican replacement proposals have focused their efforts. 

The current front-runners for GOP replacements appear to be:

* Paul Ryan's [A Better Way](https://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-HealthCare-PolicyPaper.pdf) 

* Orrin Hatch's [Patient CARE Act](http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Patient%20Choice,%20Affordability,%20Responsibility,%20and%20Empowerment%20Act.pdf)

* Tom Price's [Empowering Patients First Act](http://tomprice.house.gov/sites/tomprice.house.gov/files/HR%202300%20Empowering%20Patients%20First%20Act%202015.pdf)

Some common components of these plans include re-regulating the individual market to make premiums cheaper for younger individuals (by offering less benefits) and more expensive for older ones, protecting pre-existing conditions if continuous coverage is maintained, offering high-risk pools as a safety-net, changing Medicaid funding, and capping the tax-exclusion for insurance through employers.

1) How effective might the elements of these plans be with regards to creating affordable premiums, encouraging insurance companies to offer competitive plans, and reducing the underinsure population? 

2) If similar plans have been tried before anywhere, what were their outcomes? 

3) If these measures aren't effective at increasing coverage and reducing costs, what policy changes would be?

To my thinking, this calls into question the whole idea of fake news really affecting the outcome.

So, **is there evidence that ties voting patterns in key states or demographics to a belief in fake news stories?** Is there a correlation between voter belief in fake news and turnout, such that those who believed fake news favorable to Trump were more likely to show up to the polls? 

Clearly, it would be good if the electorate made all its choices based purely on the facts, so I'm not suggesting that fake news isn't a problem. But I'd like to understand how big an influence it actually had on the electoral outcome.

289,b71r8q,False,None,50,"The statistical methodology used in 2019 in the Supreme Court to argue against gerrymandering is markedly different than the 2017 'efficiency gap' method. How specifically are these statistical analyses different, and what were their respective determinations on gerrymandering?",NeutralPolitics,"A 2004 gerrymandering case, [Vieth v. Jubelirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer), concluded with a suggestion from now retired Justice Kennedy that perhaps there could be a measurement system to determine when political gerrymandering [had gone too far](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/justice-kennedy-on-hot-seat-in-major-voting-rights-case-idUSKCN1C81P2):

> Kennedy parted with his conservative colleagues to suggest that if partisan gerrymandering went too far, violating the Constitution, courts may have to step in if a “workable standard” for deciding when to do that could be found.

This was relevant in a case argued in 2017, [Gill v. Whitford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_v._Whitford), where an [efficiency gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/courts-law/gerrymander/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e119295bb0fa) method was used to measure political gerrymandering. 

The 'efficiency gap' method was ultimately not a suitable standard, even though it may have measured the political gerrymandering effect just fine, because it didn't suitably demonstrate [individual harm to voters](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandering-decision/index.html), and therefore the plaintiffs didn't have standing based on that model:

> The court opted instead to send the case back to the lower court so the challengers might have another chance to ""prove concrete and particularized injuries"" by showing there had been a burden on their individual votes. That showing, in turn, would allow the challengers to proceed to the merits of the case.

2019 and a political gerrymandering is at the [Supreme Court again](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/26/supreme-court-takes-gerrymandering-testing-n-c-maryland-maps/3236039002/). 

This time, the court will be looking at two maps: one gerrymandered to give Republicans 10 out of 13 seats in North Carolina, and a second to give Democrats 7 out of 8 seats in Maryland.

While the arguments against these maps go beyond statistical analysis, it's notable a different method from the 'efficiency gap' is being used for the math side [in these arguments](https://theconversation.com/want-to-fix-gerrymandering-then-the-supreme-court-needs-to-listen-to-mathematicians-114345):

> The answer to such objections, adeptly addressed in an amicus brief by MIT’s Eric Lander, is twofold. First, the maps being challenged are so biased that they are extreme outliers. They would show up as anomalies under any test for partisanship. So there is no need for the Supreme Court to set a numerical cutoff level at this stage – though a threshold may, indeed, evolve in the future. Secondly, such an extreme outlier approach is already an indispensable tool in several areas of national importance. For example, it is used to test nuclear safety, predict hurricanes and assess the health of financial institutions.

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Specifically, how is the newer 'outlier' methodology different from the 'efficiency gap' analysis?

2: Do they come to different determination in severity of gerrymandering/how do they represent the severity?

My Questions:

* What are the legal paths and executive powers that a sitting president can use without congressional legislation to forgive any amount of student debt?

This is regardless of a country's economic development level.


I understand that Green Parties have their own Political International organisation, the [Global Greens](https://www.globalgreens.org/) with their own [charter](https://www.globalgreens.org/globalcharter).  In the charter, of course is the pledge to phase out nuclear power.


Any Green political party with any influence (whether it is from the U.K, Taiwan or Brazil) is a member of the global Greens movement and holds the same beliefs and policies with little deviation.


However, it doesn't really explain why the stance on nuclear power is such a core tenet of Green politics though.

&nbsp;

So there's really a few questions:

&nbsp;

Why is the anti-nuclear movement so strongly correlated with Green political parties to the point that there's no notable Green/pro-environmental Parties that have a different stance on nuclear power?

Is it because an anti-nuclear stance is a law of nature for pro-environmental groups?  Or is it simply the consequence that coalition/consensus building must inevitably involve anti-nuclear issues?  Because this trend is remarkably consistent.

Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?     
A: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.

After a series of commands that lasted nearly five minutes ([during which observers suggest the police had several opportunities to cuff Shaver and end the stand-off](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/8/16752914/police-arizona-philip-brailsford-daniel-shaver)), Officer Phillip Brailsford interpreted a gesture from Shaver toward his wasteband to be aggressive, and shot him five times, behavior which resulted his [leaving the police force](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2017/12/06/trial-ex-mesa-arizona-cop-shooting-nashville-native-heads-into-deliberations/926217001/) but, nonetheless [did not lead to his conviction of the subsequent murder charge](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa-breaking/2017/12/07/philip-brailsford-verdict-daniel-shaver-killing/927052001/).

The [vast majority of responses from observers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=daniel%20shaver&src=tyah) express horror at the act itself or how harshly Shaver was treated prior to the officer opening fire or both.

A commentary from a fellow officer (in a different police department) on the Blaze acquiesces to the notion that [Brailsford committed a crime (though he insists manslaughter and not murder is the more appropriate charge)](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/14/commentary-im-a-law-enforcement-officer-what-happened-to-daniel-shaver-was-a-crime), but says that much of the behavior prior to the shooting itself was justified and complied with general principles of how police should handle such a circumstance. However, other onlookers have pointed out that [Shaver indicated multiple times his desire to comply](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mesa-arizona-police-shooting-20171208-story.html), responding, at one point, “I’m trying to do what you say."" The events that unfolded have been described by some onlookers as [an avoidable execution](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/opinions/daniel-shaver-shooting-opinion-gagliano/index.html). Other observers have added that the police were, from the outset, [armed, hostile, brusque and perhaps most importantly, made no attempt to and indicated no desire to, de-escalate the tension of the situation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/).

Irrespective of one's opinion of this case, this is an instance of the state taking a life when the suspect in question was unarmed, and, in retrospect, [had likely not even committed a crime](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/). The Huffington Post, after the video, has asserted one possible policy remedy for preventing occurrences like this in the future: [disarming the police](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disarming-the-police-would-have-prevented-daniel-shavers_us_5a3438a4e4b02bd1c8c6069c). Other work, by Aaron Kovisto in the American Journal of Public Health suggests the more effective remedy may point the other way: [police shootings are less common in jurisdictions with stricter gun control](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303770). This implies incidents like the one involving Shaver would be less common (possibly far less common) if police were not forced to assume that nearly every suspect they encounter were armed with deadly and easily hidden weapons. In other words, [if scared police officers are scary](http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/13/scared-cops-are-scary), perhaps society should take steps to make sure police officers are operating in a less scary environment.

This post takes as a given the notion that police shootings of unarmed citizens is a serious public problem. As such, given that premise, does a policy response that disarms or reduces the armaments of police officers and/or civilians make sense to reduce police shootings of citizens? If not, why not?

324,eab63w,False,None,238,How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report?,NeutralPolitics,"**How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report?**

With the recent release of the Inspector General’s report the process in which FISA warrants were obtained against Carter Page, I feel that it’s worthwhile to re-examine the Nunes Memo and the Democrat’s reply memo (aka “Demo”). We have the benefit of two years of additional information, and the IG’s recent report gives both more and less information than we had before.

This has been a topic that has been addressed before here in this subreddit, so long-time readers may recall some of the past threads over the years.

Nunes made several claims in his Feb 2018 letter, and within a month it was [announced]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inspector-general-announces-he-will-review-justice-departments-surveillance-of-former-trump-campaign-adviser/2018/03/28/23651efe-32bb-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html) that the Inspector General would be looking into the FISA warrants. 

**Questions presented**

* How do Nunes’ claims hold up now that we have more information? 
* How does the Democratic memo hold up?
* Does the IG’s report support claims made by Nunes and/or the Democrats rebuttal?


Specifically, Nunes said that “material and relevant information was omitted,” from the FISA applications. I will try my best to summarize what Nunes claims below:

1. The initial and renewal applications did not contain information that the DNC paid for Steele’s dossier as a means to obtain derogatory information on Trump’s ties to Russia, and it does not mention that Steele was authorized payment by the FBI. 
2. Furthermore, Fusion GPS’s and Perkins Coie’s roles were not disclosed despite the ties being known by the DOJ.
3. The applications cited a Yahoo News article as corroborating evidence for Steele’s work when in fact Steele leaked his information to Yahoo news. Steele should have been terminated in September but concealed his activities from the FBI.
4. Steele maintained contacts with the FBI through Bruce Ohr, and through Ohr the FBI learned that Steele was biased and that this bias did not make it into the applications or the renewals. Also, Ohr’s wife worked for Fusion GPS and both persons’ ties to Steele and Fusion GPS were concealed from the FISC.
5. Steele’s information wasn’t corroborated at the time of the initial FISA application. Deputy Director McCabe said that that without the Steele dossier, there would have not been a FISA warrant.
6. The FISA warrant mentions Papadopoulos and how it triggered a counterintelligence investigation but does not link them together in a conspiracy.
7. The Strozk/Page text messages are indications of bias.

Meanwhile, then-minority House Democrats and also made a series of claims, which I will again try my best to summarize:

1. FBI and DOJ officials did not “abuse the FISA process, omit material information, or subvert the [FISA process]"" to spy on the Trump campaign
2. The DOJ used a “multi-pronged rationale” that narrowly used Steele’s information along with independent sources
3. The FBI was transparent with the FISC about Steele’s “background, credibility, and potential bias.” The Court was also informed that Steele was terminated as a source for making unauthorized disclosures.
4. The planned DOJ payment against Steele was cancelled.
5. The DOJ appropriately included Papadopoulos in the FISA application, and excluding it would have been negligent.
6. Bruce Ohr’s role was mischaracterized by the Nunes Memo.
7. Peter Strozk and Lisa Page’s text messages are irrelevant.

Note: If I missed something in my summary, please advise and I will try to correct. It's challenging to distill down 15+ pages of accusations and counter-accusations into handful of neutrally-framed sentences, and any omission is unintentional.

Are there any persons/groups that certainly do have legal standing?,NeutralPolitics,"[President Trump will declare a National Emergency today](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) over immigration at the Southern border ([The order has now been announced](https://www.apnews.com/5b22a4a54ba046c4815c31bca2c92ae7)).

The order is likely to meet outside legal challenges (From 1st source):

> A parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre-written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as “an outrageous abuse of power” by an “unstable and increasingly autocratic” president, as one of the groups, Public Citizen, put it.

In Congress, there is potential for [a joint resolution to block the emergency order](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-congress-national-emergency.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), however without two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate, the president could easily veto it:

> Under the National Emergencies Act, the House and the Senate can take up what is called a joint resolution of termination to end the emergency status if they believe the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated.  

...

> To keep a president’s party from bottling such a measure up, the law says that if one chamber passes such a resolution, the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days. Though Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, they would need only a handful of Republicans to join them to pass the resolution there and send it to Mr. Trump’s desk. 

Aside from a joint resolution, The New York times describes the House as having two legal options: Democrats could either sue or they could join a third party lawsuit. There is a caveat in that if the House itself sues, they might not have legal 'standing' (From 3rd source):

> There are questions about the House’s legal standing if it were to try to sue on its own, and House leaders and their lawyers will have to decide if it is worth risking filing suit themselves only to be dismissed by a judge for lack of standing. 

----

I have a few questions about lawsuits involving Trump's emergency order:

1: Do Democrats have legal standing to sue over Trump's emergency declaration? Specifically, how could they gain standing?

2: Democrats might also join a third party suit. Are there any third party groups or individuals that would certainly have standing against Trump's order?

Bonus side thing: What is legal 'standing'?

[This article written before the election](http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/italy-election-2018-what-you-need-to-know-2018-2) goes over the electoral system, the emergence of the Five Star Movement and predictions.


Main coalitions:

The center-left coalition is primarily made up of the Democratic Party (PD), but also includes More Europe (+E), Together (I), Popular Civic List (CP), SVP-PATT, and Aosta Valley (VdA)

The center-right coalition is primarily made up of League/Lega Nord (L), Forza Italia (FI), but also includes the Brothers of Italy (FdI), and Us with Italy (NcI). 

The main parties in the election were:  

• [Democratic Party (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(Italy\)): A center-left party devoted to social democracy and social liberalism. The party is a result of the merger of numerous center-left parties, and has been in power since 2013.   

• [League (L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord): League, or Lega Nord, is a regional right-wing political party advocating populism, federalism and is a strong opponent of globalization, immigration and a soft Euroskeptic party.

An Order also prevents the person from buying additional guns for a one year period. The law is nicknamed “Red Flag Law” for when a person exhibits a ‘red flag’ or other indicator that they may be a harm to themselves, or others. It is one of the few tools that family and household members have to quickly remove a weapon from somebody who is at risk.

Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire covers 109 square miles (282 km^2 ) in the area around Thousand Oaks and Malibu west of Los Angeles and is 0% contained.

President Trump has stated that the fires are due to [forest mismanagement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-mismanagement-forests-blame-california-fires-181110085539030.html) on California's part, and has threatened to cut off federal funding if that is not remedied.

However, a spokesperson for CA Governor Jerry Brown and the president of California Professional Firefighters have both stated that nearly [60% of California's forests are under federal control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/10/trump-blames-gross-mismanagement-wildfires-leave-trail-death-destruction-california/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.70481f8af284), including a majority of the areas affected by the fires, and that the state has increased its funding for forest services while the federal government has cut back funding for it.

Sources for claims in title (basically electoral data), plus involved parties political alignment:

1. [AMI](http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/), Association of Municipalities for Independence (link is official webpage), has, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Municipalities_for_Independence), *""the support of 786 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (82,9%). In addition, 39 out of 42 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.""*

2. The lasting ~20% of City Councils are owned by PSC and CSQEP, which are center-left and hard-left leaning parties that are part of state-wide parties ([PSOE-PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia)) and coalitions (CSQEP and [Podemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\(Spanish_political_party\))). Those parties are the actual opposition in [the Spanish Congress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_Congress_of_Deputies_\(12th_Legislature\).svg). PSOE (the main spanish opposition party right now —homologous of Democrats in the US, and Labour in the UK) rejected 155 application during all the legislature, but has backed it once the PP-Ciudadanos Government pushed for it earlier this week; Podemos, the 3th party in seats, rejects it all the way.

3. Between the aforementioned City Councils ruled by PSC or CSQEP, are most of the biggest cities in Catalonia, like Barcelona and the cosmopolitan surroundings, Tarragona, or Lleida, making 3 of 4 the province Capitals. This shows an interesting part of the whole point, imo: the political weight that life in big cities —""modern, cosmopolitan life""— has in these kind of matters that affect the rest of a territory, with lower density.

4. Albeit those ~20% of City Councils aren't part of the Association of Municipalities for Independence, many of them have already [openly rejected](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171021/432245123748/alcaldes-psc-piden-rechazar-155.html) the application of 155 —including the Barcelona one, which mayor is part of CSQEP, the coalition party that rejects it in the Spanish Congress. This doesn't mean they will not abide, but it shows their disconformity.

5. The actual [government in Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XII_legislatura_de_Espa%C3%B1a), elected in 2016 and that pushed for the 155 application this past week, is mainly PP with the support Ciudadanos. Between those 2 parties, they rule one single tiny town in Catalonia (sourced in next point).

5.

Further context:

**What is the 155 article of the Spanish Constitution, and why has it been pushed?**

- The 155 article of the Spanish Constitution [was pushed by Spain's Government](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/21/inenglish/1508587023_487115.html) this past weekend, and will have to go through the Senate to be approved. Such article is [a measure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%C3%ADculo_155_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978) to shield the State from disobedience in any autonomous community, when any autonomous government (in this case, the catalan Generalitat of Catalonia) rejects following the requests of the Central Government, which would be backed by the Constitutional law that rules us all.

- The reason for Madrid's central government applying the 155 is the Catalan Government push for an Unillateral Declaration of Independence. The reason the Catalan Government has been able to push for that it's because it has [an absolute majority in seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), as of the last elections in pro-Yes parties. After the 'illegal referendum' as the finishing point of the legislature —complying with the main point of their electoral promises— the Independence of Catalonia was [announced yet immediatelly suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence), after the 1st of October vote. The immediate suspension was to call for a dialogue in terms, for negotiating a better way out —a legal one— than the unillateral, after the Catalan Government considered the [1st of October 'illegal' referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017) success substantial enough to push for independence. That kind of measure has been compared with the [Slovenian way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioni_Agreement) of gaining independence in 1991.

- This suspenden situation lasted about a month, and the Central Government finally pushed for the 155 to prevent anything else from happening. This will take away any political power from the Catalan Government, rendering the Catalan President unable to push for anything, overtaking any offices they consider necessary for the time being, plus the control of catalan autonomous police, and the public media apparently, too. In other words, the 155 is an 'à la carte' article to make the territories follow the Constitutional law.

- Pushing that article will mean that PP, a party with [8.49% of the votes in Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), will rule that territory for a while —only with the backing of Ciudadanos though, a party that has 17.90% of the vote in Catalonia, summing to 26,4% of the votes of the territory with PP. This engorges 1/4th of the people entitlement, while it creates greater distress over the 48% of pro-Yes voters, being the distress present but lesser in the lasting ~25% (pro-legal-referendum parties).

- Albeit the main goal of the PP is, allegedly, to call for new elections in the Catalan Parliament as soon as possible, [polls show](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171022/encuesta-elecciones-cataluna-6371299) that the independentist simple majority is consolidated, showing a quasi-identic scenario. As such, pushing for them isn't solving anything apparently, making the situation stuck and unsustainable long term.

Last but not least, for context on independentism in the contemporary world, mainly Europe:

- [Unillateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence), being Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo, the last ones in Europe the last half of a Century, after wars and violent episodes.

- ~~Non-unilateral~~ [declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence), in modern Europe, include mainly the countries that were former parts of the USSR, like the Baltic Countries and many Balkanian ones.

**edit**: removed ""non-unilateral"", as that was an error of mine adding it for emphasis, and /u/CQME kindly addressed that this was not right.

---

So, for the question/s, I guess they are:

- **Are there any other modern territories where virtually none of the local councils are represented by the main party, or any coalition, that rules the upper instances of the territory, outside of it?**

- **Are such scenarios sustainable only by the rule of law, which is the only thing the Spanish main parties have said they'll follow, ever?**

---

I'm quite illiterate in terms of history and politics, but the closest situations I know of are:

- The Northern Ireland situation, where they're mainly overruled by the UK in many things (part of the peace treaties), albeit Wikipedia shows me that [there're a big deal of local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) ruled by unionist parties in Northern Ireland —as far as I can tell, unionist conservative parties like DUP are part of the Conservatives main party, in the House of Commons, and Labour does too, so there's indeed some balance there.

- In Spain, the other really distinct autonomous community, the Basque Country, has too [3 out of 251](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Popular_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco#Elecciones_municipales_y_forales_2015) city councils.

> KELLY: Yeah. You know, pick a country. The thing that we're looking for is when a person comes in, the State Department does these interviews. Someone comes in and says, I want to come to the United States. Then we ask them to give us a list of websites that they visit and the passwords to get on those websites to see what they're looking at. This is...

> MARTIN: You require that of anyone who is looking to immigrate to the U.S.?

Europe, the United States maintains databases and shares those databases. So these are some of the things we're thinking about.

My initial concern would be over whether this type of invasive screening would be legal, but I think more important would be the question of its implementation.

1) Do the existing provisions (4th amendment) apply here (EFF seem to think it does based on Riley v California: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/fear-materialized-border-agents-demand-social-media-data-americans) or since the proposed policy changes are specific to visitors does the 4th not apply?

Over the weekend, Trump [asserted](https://www.apnews.com/be18b8619cde4658a418dda4f416968a) that he holds such broad power thanks to the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act), a piece of legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter.

My questions:

1. What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view?
2. What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions?
3. In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order?

This begs the question, are welfare work requirements effective? 

Two states seem to have done studies. [Maine produced this report](http://www.maine.gov/economist/docs/TANF%20Report%20Final%205-25-17.pdf) after instituting work requirements for food stamp recipients who were fit for work and found significant growth in incomes and decreases in joblessness.

However, [The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities produced this report](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows) which found that, while joblessness decreases initially, the effects may not persist. 

I think another fair question to be asked in this discussion is, how should we measure the effectiveness of our welfare programs?

Is this contract unusual in form?  Are there provisions which are atypical or prohibited in government contracts.  In particular I wonder about Article 59 of the contract, which states:

>The Contractor agrees to provide PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the Contractor which are directly pertinent to this Contract for the purposes of making audits, examination, excerpts, and transctipstions, during the Contractor's performance of the contract and for up to three (3) years after Contractor's receipt of final payment under the Contract. **In no event shall PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements of the labor rates specified herein.**

(Emphasis added)

Is there precedent for a contractor like Whitefish getting a contract like this?  If so, is it a good precedent or bad precedent?

My reading of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) is that the debt ceiling seems like an artifact resulting from the fact that Congress used to authorize every single debt individually; as the US economy and debt grew, this was just shifted to an aggregate authorization:

>Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution, only Congress can authorize the borrowing of money on the credit of the United States. From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issued. To provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorized debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.[3] Under this Act, Congress established an aggregate limit, or ""ceiling,"" on the total amount of new bonds that could be issued.

353,5q7ssu,False,None,175,Does President Trump's international business empire cause conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution?,NeutralPolitics,"-----

**Introduction:**

-----

I am a lawyer with an interest in Constitutional Law, but I practice Family Law and therefore may not have the absolute best grasp of the interpretation of Constitutional Law.

Moreover, the Emoluments Clause is somewhat obscure, not often covered or taught in law school, and not often discussed in my area of law other than theoretically.

I am posting to foster discussion on this topic, learn, and better understand how President Trump's business empire interacts with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution.

-----

**Sources:**

-----

The information I have gathered purporting a violation of the Emoluments Clause is best summed up in [this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gs_121616_emoluments-clause1.pdf) paper. 

The authors are;

The information I have gathered purporting there is no violation of the Emoluments Clause is best summed up in [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2902391) paper.

The author is;

-----

**Summary:**

-----

I implore you to read both papers in their entirety, but for brevity sake as a brief introduction, or as a refresher after you've read them - here is my understanding of the argument that these papers make.

-----

[Article I, Section 9](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/68/emoluments-clause) of the Constitution provides as follows: “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And **no Person holding any Office** of Profit or Trust under them, **shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”**

-----

Violation?

-----

The Eisen paper argues for a broad interpretation of the clause, stating **""...the Clause unquestionably reaches any situation in which a federal officeholder receives money, items of value, or services from a foreign state.**

The Eisen paper concludes that **While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive—by virtue of his continued interest in the Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities—a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents.** Applied to Mr. Trump’s diverse dealings, **the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed.**  

-----

No Violation?

-----

The Grewal paper argues for a narrower interpretation, stating that **""...Only transactions conducted at other than arm’s length, or transactions involving the provision of services by the President personally, establish potential violations.""**

Under an office-related definition, the sale of goods generally would not give to emoluments, such as where she sold property at an arm’s length price to a foreign government. Under this reading, only goods sold at other than fair market value would trigger an Emoluments analysis.

**Specific Instances of Potential Foul Play:**

**Discussion Outline:**

-----

I'd like to refrain from discussing the penalties for violating the Emoluments Clause, how important you think the Emoluments Clause is in relation to other issues, or whether or not you think violating the Emoluments Clause matters.

The main points I'd like to discuss have to do with the text and interpretation of the Emoluments Clause as applied to President Trump's international business presence and whether or not it has been or is being violated.

Another interesting point of discussion is how most Presidents have used a ""blind trust"" to circumvent problems regarding the Emoluments Clause - in which you place pre-Presidential personal holdings in a trust and give complete control to an independent third party - and how President Trump's discussion of ""[giving control to his son](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-business-conflicts-plan/)"" may or may not cure the defect or satisfy the blind trust requirements of an independent third party.

Last, I would like to discuss which interpretation of the Emoluments Clause is better to achieve the goal of anti-corruption from foreign powers, and which of the enumerated specific instances you believe either do or no not violate one or both interpretations of the Emoluments Clause. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5q7ssu/does_president_trumps_international_business/,565,"This may sound like a way to sweetened version, but I'd *think* since the clause is in article 1 it only applies to congress.

With the recent Supreme Court case, [Impression v.

361,6axlne,False,None,199,What evidence exists around the idea that high-income earners are likely to move to avoid higher taxes?,NeutralPolitics,"One of the biggest news stories in the UK currently is the leak/release of Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election, which you can find through here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39877439

Many of these proposals - such as re-nationalising the railways, spending £8bn pounds on social care, building 100,000 new homes - will be expensive. Labour say they will be able to pay for its policies by increasing taxes on the rich, for example 'increasing income tax for the highest-earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS'.

While Labour have rejected this, this current manifesto has been compared to their previous pledges in the 1970s and 80s, especially the 1983 manifesto: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39872189. Those policies remain controversial today - the high income tax-rates of 1970s Britain under Labour (83% on the richest earners) even caused Rod Stewart to move to L.A. and name an album about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Crossing

Granted, this is just one case of a very rich guy packing up because he's being taxed quite highly. But there are numerous studies that support both sides of the argument: that rich people do leave - in significant enough numbers - when a high tax-rate is introduced, or that rich people don't leave - in significant enough numbers - when one is introduced (have put links at the bottom).

So...

- Which side is generally supported by economists?
- If it exists, has the frequency of 'rich migration' varied over time?
- And do the benefits of higher taxes outweigh the impact of those high earners leaving?

*Note: if it helps for the argument, this can be related to taxes over than income-tax. Capital gains, property, inheritance etc., but income-tax is the main one I'm focused on atleast. Also, this is mainly concerned with the West/US and UK, but with the nature of globalisation today I can understand how practically all countries' tax-rates may link into it.*

The article states that the government switching from paying full price for public health expenses to a fixed amount per visit caused insurance companies to start acting more like businesses. This is allegedly what caused healthcare costs to skyrocket in America. The article says that an overall push toward deregulation and HMO's also played a role.

The public alternative will provide the same essential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.

Proponents of the plan argue that it provides all Americans with affordable healthcare coverage without the expense that comes with replacing private healthcare, and would incentivize private healthcare to keep their prices low. Opponents ([New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/medicare-for-all.html) incoming) argue that: ""the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending.

Obstruction of justice is defined under [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and committed by those who “[corruptly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515), or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.”

As [this write up in Lawfare](https://lawfareblog.com/was-firing-james-comey-obstruction-justice) explains (excellent read), there are 3 elements of proof in order to find a crime: 

1. there was a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States;
2. the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending
3. the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the 
proceeding was pending.

Continuing Lawfare's post:
> The questions here surround the third element. One must not merely “influent, obstruct, or impede” but also do so corruptly. Under § 1515(b), a corrupt state of mind requires intent: “acting with an improper purpose. [...] Ultimately the answer goes to the motives: Did the President or Attorney General intend for Comey’s firing to “influence, obstruct, or impede” the Russia investigation? ”

The leaks provide evidence for significant movements of illicit money around the world, including [12 world leaders and a wide range of other important officials and their relatives](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) from nations as diverse as Russia, the UK, Sudan, Rwanda and Iceland. One [especially tantalizing finding](http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/all-the-presidents-men-vladimir-putins-secret-money-network/) was the uncovering of a $2 billion network connected to Vladimir Putin.

The law firm in question, Mossack Fonseca, is, according to NPR, one of the largest incorporators in the world, involved in the process of setting up shell corporations and offshore accounts. While neither activity is illegal, both are [frequently used](https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/files/LLCAssessment_FINAL.pdf) to facilitate financial fraud.

While the leaks are still fairly recent and thus, thorough analysis still difficult to find, preliminary reports implicate a huge number of officials from nations rich and poor, democratic and autocratic alike.

In light of [a developing controversy about a sexual assault allegation against Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/woman-broadens-claims-against-biden-include-sexual-assault-n1182296), Elizabeth Bruenig [writes in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html) that Democrats need to ""consider a plan B"":

> I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020. 

If Democrats do change their minds and no longer think Biden is their strongest candidate for the November election, this raises several questions about their other options:

* Procedurally, how would it work? If Biden withdraws, does the nomination automatically go to the runner-up (currently Bernie Sanders), or are the delegates pledged to Biden reassigned in some way?
* If Biden doesn't choose to withdraw voluntarily, can the party disqualify him anyway, within its current rules?
* If Biden receives the nomination and names a running mate, but he departs the race before Election Day, can he still be replaced or is his former running mate then the effective presidential candidate?
* How much leverage the remaining state primary elections hold if Democratic voters quickly change their mind about Biden?
* What is the timeline of when certain options become impossible for the Democratic Party?

late EDIT: my previous phrasing was incorrect because the other candidates have [suspended their campaigns but not officially withdrawn](https://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/10/what-does-suspending-mean-2/), so Biden could theoretically withdraw in a more real sense than his former rivals have done, which might have implications for party procedure",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/geam0x/can_the_democratic_party_replace_joe_biden_as_its/,528,[removed] ,2020-05-06 01:25:21

Those laws are:

* [**AB-450**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB450) which requires in relevant part that California employers not provide information to Federal immigration agents, or allow them access to nonpublic areas, except as required by federal law or when presented with a warrant, subpoena or other court order.

* [**AB-103**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB103) which requires  the Attorney General of California, or his or her designee, to engage in reviews of county, local, or private locked detention facilities in which noncitizens are being housed or detained for purposes of civil immigration proceedings in California.

* [**SB-54**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54) which prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from sharing information with the US government around immigrants in California custody, or transferring them to Federal custody, with some exceptions for certain listed felonies, and for when a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination is presented to California authorities.

The DoJ argues that these laws are invalid under the [supremacy clause of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause)  because they ""reflect a deliberate effort by
California to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law.""

In a recent similar case, one of the Federal laws the DoJ is asking to be found supreme [was found to be unconstitutional](http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who/sanctuary-litigation) under the 10th amendment by a US District Court.

That's pretty much it for the defined roles of the Vice President. When acting as the President of the Senate, the VP's role is subject to the Senate's rules.

Per Senate Rule VII ""MORNING BUSINESS"" Part 3 [Rules of the Senate](https://www.rules.senate.gov/rules-of-the-senate),
>The Presiding Officer may at any time lay, and it shall be in order at any time for a Senator to move to lay, before the Senate, any bill or other matter sent to the Senate by the President or the House of Representatives for appropriate action allowed under the rules and any question pending at that time shall be suspended for this purpose. Any motion so made shall be determined without debate.

(When acting as President of the Senate, the Vice President is by definition the Presiding Officer.)

Specifically for the Presiding Officer, the text says, ""The Presiding Officer may at any time lay ... before the Senate, any bill or other matter sent to the Senate by ... the House of Representatives for appropriate action allowed under the rules..."" As near as I can tell, this means the bill goes directly before the Senate (instead of coming up for a motion to be considered like when legislation is submitted by a Senator).

The Senate Majority Leader can apparently refuse to allow bills before the Senate for a vote through the various ways the role of Presiding Officer is delegated by the Rules of the Senate, but it seems to me that the rules also imply that if he or she is presiding the Vice President can place a bill from the House on the calendar for a vote. I'm sure I'm missing something, since keyword searches will only get me so far through the parlimentary mess that is the Senate rules. Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/clzlhg/can_the_vice_president_force_legislation_from_the/,528,"The Vice President isn't necessarily the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer is the person who recognizes a member of the body to speak, who officially calls for and usually tallies the votes, etc. It's more of a ceremonial position.

But this rule you quote mostly means that they officially call the beginning of the vote, not that they allow or schedule the vote.

 [According to a piece in the Palmer Report](http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/trump-apparently-didnt-realize-steve-bannon-will-need-senate-confirmation-security-council/1282/) (I'm uncertain to its credibility), Bannon may now have to go through Senate approval because he doesn't meet the criteria of the five per-approved groups:

That obscure law, which has remained obscure because no president has ever tried to put a political hack on the NSC until now, was dug up by MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter late on Monday night. 

I looked up the law ([located here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/3021)) and while it does specify the groups expected to be included I see no mention that falling outside of these pre-established roles subjects Bannon to Senate scrutiny.

>Worried about the political and legal implications, the chief of staff, William M. Daley, reached out to the proposal’s author, Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary. How, he wondered, had the White House been put in this situation with so little presidential input? “You are way out there on a limb on this,” he recalls telling her.

>“It was then made clear to me that, no, there were senior White House officials who had been involved and supported this,” said Mr. Daley, who left his post early this year.

>What he did not realize was that while he was trying to put out what he considered a fire, the person fanning the flames was sitting just one flight up from him: Valerie Jarrett, the Obamas’ first friend, the proposal’s chief patron and a tenacious White House operator who would ultimately outmaneuver not only Mr. Daley but also the vice president in her effort to include the broadest possible contraception coverage in the administration’s health care overhaul.

>From the first, her official job has been somewhat vague. But nearly four years on, with Mr. Obama poised to accept his party’s renomination this week, her standing is clear, to her many admirers and detractors alike. “She is the single most influential person in the Obama White House,” said one former senior White House official, who like many would speak candidly only on condition of anonymity.

This is the analogous comparison to Bannon. And every time you have a question about the propriety or history of the position, you can easily search Jarret - who was Obama's right hand for 8 years.

Absolutely not. 1) Namely because they do not actually control what is going on in political sphere. 2) money is being spent campaigning NOT being given to the candidate for his/her personal use.

Simply because the Koch's donate toward Ted Cruz does mean Ted Cruz is now forced to go along with the Koch's entire platform. On the contrary, Cruz would have probably lowered taxes either way, judging by his history. Furthermore, Ted Cruz hasn't accepted their criminal justice platform so their oligarchness doesn't seem to be really effective.

I know everyone likes to make a big fuss about NRA donations and all that jazz. But the almost always donate to pro-gun politicians. More importantly, it's their endorsement that holds a lot of weight. I know you didn't ask about them specifically but it's an easy example to point to. How many politicians were actually ANTI-gun and then later become pro gun? the NRA for example is paid by it's members to fight tooth and nail against everything. I'm a member of the Gun Owners of America that want fully-automatics to be legal. I don't. But I'd rather have them fight for more than what I want.

 Also I'd like to point out that the us was never a democracy, it's a constitutional representative republic. So some issues, such as burning the flag, despite a vast majority of people wanting that scotus decision overturned, can't be done without a constitutional amendment to protect against the tyranny of the majority.

Also I'm not sure the author of the princeton studies you are citing is the most honest. I'm trying to dig through his sources to find what specific surveys he is citing, and I found an excerpt (I think) on Harvard's cite, where he spends a page on this this statement 
“There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one:
a complete lack of a policy apparatus.
What you've got is everything -- and I mean everything -- being run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis.” regarding Bush the younger. Take that as you will.


I wasn't actually able to find his ACTUAL survey for the data he uses but I'm going to point that more broadly he might just be ignoring that that is a side affect of our representative democracy.

We're never going to get everyone who we want. I want criminal justice reform, but free speech and guns are most important to me so I'll vote Republican. Or people who care about healthcare but don't want one million immigrants a year. They're compromising, that's part of a representative democracy.  ",2018-05-29 17:03:41

To summarize- in this article Greenwald argues a kind of moral equivalence between the United States' use of military drones to kill suspected terrorists in the ME and a hypothetical action by Turkey to assassinate Fathullah Gulen in Pennsylvania. (Gulen is the cleric Erdogan claims is responsible for Friday's failed military coup in Turkey. He has been living in the USA since 1999, despite repeated requests by Erdogan that he be extradited.)

Greenwald concludes his article with a harsh rebuke of what he describes as an American ""pathology"":

>U.S. drone kills of terror suspects (including its own citizens) are extremely popular among Americans, including (in the age of Obama) those who self-identify as liberal Democrats. Yet it’s virtually certain that Americans across the ideological spectrum would explode in nationalistic outrage if Turkey actually did the same thing in Pennsylvania... 

> Indeed, so ingrained is this pathology that the mere suggestion that the U.S. should be subject to the same laws and rules as everyone else inevitably provokes indignant accusations that the person is guilty of the greatest sin: comparing the United States of America to the lesser, inferior governments and countries of the world.

So clearly this is a pretty provocative piece of writing, which not only touches on the news of the day but also addresses a persistent undercurrent in the national debate regarding how the United States should prosecute the offensive against terrorists abroad. 

Here is some background reading that might be helpful:

417,bvlsua,False,None,99,Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?,NeutralPolitics,"Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](
https://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes?

420,8b25l4,False,None,23,"Under the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act, online publishers are immune from liability for third-party content. What are the pros and cons of eliminating this immunity?",NeutralPolitics,"[Links posted to demonstrate underlying sentiments exist, not as a source of their truth.]

In lieu of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica breach / misuse of data, there has been a general clamor to better address online user-generated content. ProPublica has posted [four proposals](https://www.propublica.org/article/four-ways-to-fix-facebook), one of which (#3) included updating the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act to remove immunity from liability for published third-party content.

This proposal deals less with privacy and more with the questionable substantive content posted on Internet platforms such as Facebook. The [historical justification](https://www.law.com/therecorder/sites/therecorder/2017/11/10/cda-230-then-and-now-does-intermediary-immunity-keep-the-rest-of-us-healthy/) for immunity was an acknowledgment that Internet businesses were an emerging technology that needed room to breath in order to flourish, and that liability would effectively quash their ability to scale writ large:

>This strange medium-specific subsidy for online content platforms made good if not perfect sense in 1996. (My generally positive thinking about it from that time, including some reservations, can be found here.) The Internet was newly mainstream, and many content portals comprised the proverbial two people in a garage. To impose upon them the burdens of traditional media would presumably require tough-to-maintain gatekeeping. Comments sections, if they remained at all, would have to be carefully screened to avoid creating liability for the company. What made sense for a newspaper publishing at most five or six letters a day amidst its more carefully vetted articles truly couldn’t work for a small Internet startup processing thousands or even millions of comments or other contributions in the same interval. Over time, the reviews elicited by Yelp and TripAdvisor, the financial markets discussions on Motley Fool, the evolving articles on user-edited Wikipedia—all are arguably only possible thanks to that §230 immunity conferred in 1996.

The present argument for removing that liability is an acknowledged change in this landscape, namely that the Internet companies have gotten better at operating at scale, with many of the big players having requisite resources to better manage content and deal with liability claims if they fail to perform:

>Perhaps the evolution of the merits of equal treatment for state sales tax provides a good model for a refined CDA: companies below a certain size or activity threshold could benefit from its immunities, while those who grow large enough to facilitate the infliction of that much more damage from defamatory and other actionable posts might also have the resources to employ a compliance department. That would militate towards at least some standard to meet in vetting or dealing with posts, perhaps akin to the light duties of booksellers or newsstands towards the wares they stock rather than the higher ones of newspapers towards the letters they publish.

In contrast, organizations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) contend that s. 230 is the cornerstone of Internet speech protection:

>[It] would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online. In short, CDA 230 is perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the Internet to thrive since 1996.

>CDA 230 also offers its legal shield to bloggers who act as intermediaries by hosting comments on their blogs. Under the law, bloggers are not liable for comments left by readers, the work of guest bloggers, tips sent via email, or information received through RSS feeds. This legal protection can still hold even if a blogger is aware of the objectionable content or makes editorial judgments.

Recently we have approved several posts of a generally rules-compliant question where it was later revealed by OP's interactions with users in the comments that the purpose was to promote and defend a particular narrative. Many users complained that OP was acting in bad faith and that the framing of the post was not neutral, even if a literal reading of it seemed to be.

The mods are looking for feedback on what to do about such submissions. As it stands now, we're obligated to approve them, since otherwise we could rightly be accused of not complying with the rules and standards we have set.

But changing the rules to account specifically for this phenomenon would add an element of discretion. We would go from just looking at compliance with the language and source rules to also determining whether we believed the OP was posting in good faith to get answers to the questions they were posing. This would introduce an avenue for bias, or at least open us up to accusations of bias.

I take away a few things from the articles above:

* There's a growing sense among voters in the west that the winners from globalization are foreigners and the elites, while the losers are the hardworking local populations. 
* The result is that populism is on the rise.
* Left-wing and right-wing populism have the same origins. Considering them separate entities is to misunderstand the root causes.
* The power of these movements has been consistently underestimated by the political classes and the media entities who respond to them. Brexit and the nomination of Donald Trump are the clearest examples, but Spain, Greece, France and Denmark also have had recent cases of the ruling classes scrambling to maintain their hold on power in the face of populist revolts at the ballot box.
* The people, by and large, aren't buying the scary rhetoric of the ruling class about the negative consequences of setting out a populist and/or nationalist agenda.

I'd first like to know if any of those are incorrect conclusions and why.

But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

Let me be clear that I'm not passing judgment on populism here. If that is a necessary and expedient path to fair and equitable treatment of the citizenry, so be it. But [the history doesn't consistently favor that view,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) so I'm wondering if there are proven alternatives.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4q447n/globalism_brexit_and_the_rise_of_populism_is/,515,">But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

My question is why should you seek the continuing reduction of immigration barriers when immigration barriers have already been reduced.

Globalization vs populism is a bit of a false dichotomy, because while there might be those who are anti immigration, there are those who might enjoy benefits of globalization yet want to put some limits on the slippery slope due to partly valid reasons. So one can be for globalization but to a point. If globalization is without any end point or limits, then it is something that a bigger number of people will oppose.

If you keep pushing after already succeeding at reducing immigration barriers, eventually you are going to reach a point of resistance. So maybe it isn't quite fair to see the others as too anti-immigration, perhaps those who are pro globalization are too pro-immigration while the majority support immigration but controlled immigration (and then there are those who are more xenophobic).

So the wise thing could be to simply take in mind the value of not alienating people by pushing for lowering even more immigration barriers for example. So, I disagree that the most valid question is how to succeed at even more and more globalization.

Globalization is not all or nothing, and it can succeed in providing more sustainable and better results even more if we give a care about nation states democracies and even some nativism as important. Else, you are going to see more Trump and far right and more of the ugly side of nationalism. So the answer to the question of how to reduce populism in reaction to globalization is to allow space for some nationalism and for globalization to coexist, else to suffer under the people going for more populism and extreme force of nationalism.

It is also important for some diversity of opinions to exist among the elite or establishment. If they are more or less relatively uniformly pro reducing immigration barriers or pro increasing immigration from muslims, then it makes it more likely for extremists (and extremists in more issues than immigration) to be those willing to tell the public what it wants to hear.

Some of the [ways in which the policies vary](https://www.brennancenter.org/body-cam-city-map) are the time non-evidentiary video is kept; limits on recording victims, witnesses, or private situations; and whether an officer may view video before making report or statement.

Laws in other states exclude body-worn camera footage from open record requests, but provide several exceptions that enable access to videos by specific persons or for specific situations.

The goal of these provisions is to be transparent in law enforcement without unnecessarily infringing on privacy, because many [crime victims and witnesses who cooperate with police, as well as peaceful protestors, do not want to be filmed.](https://www.aclu.org/other/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all) This also affects the decision to make such recordings continuous or allow officers to turn the cameras on and off, which is [another issue of hot debate.](https://www.ibtimes.com/what-happens-when-police-turn-their-body-cameras-2050118)

[Gerrymandering](http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/gerrymandering-proving-all-politics-local), where the parties in control can redraw the districts in their favor so that even if they do not get the majority of the vote they can still win the election. The spoiler effect, the idea that even if a third party gained massive amounts of popularity they would only take [away votes from the major party that have the most in common](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-midterm-elections-spoilers/382475/) with and will lead to the other major party succeeding leading to the third party never gaining the same level of support. These issues lead to the rise of only two political parties, which are [umbrella parties for a range of political beliefs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/), which don't really satisfy anyone. 

So should we change from FPTP to another type of voting system? Would it change the deadlock we see in American government today?

[ Also for anyone interested here is an opinion piece I found that was interesting and provided a look at America with a new type of voting system though it was written 20 years ago so the ideas on the parties would probably change.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4acaiy/should_america_move_away_from_a_first_past_the/,507,">best in the world

(http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/u-s-department-of-health-and-human-services-v-florida/).

2. A ruling that Congress can constitutionally pass *any law* of *any type* just by including a non-existent tax would be (*in my opinion*} the greatest expansion of legislative branch power in our history. 

* May Congress now expand its authority into *any area* simply *by including a tax of zero*?

From this, one could infer that more than half of the hourly workforce is past the point that a job paying higher than minimum would be expected, i.e. 'work experience,' with [most salaried workers receiving a three percent raise annually](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0516/Pages/0516-fair-compensation.aspx).

One of the many [chief arguments opposing a wage increase](http://www.aei.org/publication/ten-reasons-economists-object-to-the-minimum-wage/) is that increasing such a wage may drive retailers to increase their prices to recoup the costs, defeating the purpose of a wage increase if said increase is to amp up the spending power of the labor class.

439,8qvwvw,False,None,48,[META] Reminders and clarifications about the rules and moderation in r/NeutralPolitics,NeutralPolitics,"Dear users,

The mods here feel like it's time for some reminders about how this subreddit is run.

Primarily, as we write at the top of every post:

> /r/NeutralPolitics is a curated space. 

> In order not to get your comment removed, please familiarize yourself with our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) before you participate.

A lot of people seem to ignore this, but we're begging you… **please read the rules!**

Now, here are a few refreshers on the specifics…

**Why are sources required?**

The requirement to provide sources for all assertions of fact (Rule 2) is part of the [founding ethos of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) Many things people believe to be true are, in fact, not. Providing sources is the best way to support your assertions. It is our cornerstone philosophy.

**How to handle requests for sources.**

Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith. What may seem ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" to you is often not to others. So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to support your statement, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. They're not an assault or a challenge. Think of them as an invitation to provide knowledge.

**""You can just google it.""**

No. It's the responsibility of the person making the claim to support it. It's also far more efficient for the one person making the assertion to link to the source than to charge thousands of individual readers with supporting it.

**There's no exception for ""common knowledge.""**

[This is explicitly stated in the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) because ""common knowledge"" is poorly defined and completely subjective. What qualifies as common knowledge to one person might be a shocking fact to another. For example, people who are new to a topic or are from cultures other than the dominant one in the discussion may have no idea about these supposedly ""common"" pieces of knowledge.

Additionally, statements of ""common knowledge"" are often wrong. The fact that a large number of people may believe something has [no bearing on whether or not it's true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

We occasionally get pushback from users on this point, and it often takes the form of something like, ""Do I have to source that the sky is blue?"" This is a convenient example for a few reasons:

1. The sky is *not* blue. It only looks that way to us because of [human physiology](https://www.livescience.com/320-blue-skies-eye-beholder.html) and how the [light scatters through the atmosphere.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/)
2. Even at that, it doesn't always appear blue. It's red and orange at sunrise and sunset, white on an overcast day, gray when there are rain clouds, and black at night.
3. Finally, this is a political discussion forum, so any assertion about the color of the sky is likely to be removed for being off topic. The same goes for similar examples, like ""water is wet."" When we get into political topics, there's actually much *less* agreement on what constitutes common knowledge, so we don't accept any of it.

**Removal reasons (we don't always post them)**

The mods try to reply with a reason for each removed comment. However, users have repeatedly complained that heavily redacted threads get crowded with removal reasons, making it hard to find the actual content. 

That in mind, there are some situations where we don't post them. The most common is when they're in a chain that is off-topic or stemming from a rule-violating comment. In that case, we'll just nuke the whole chain rather than post a dozen or so removal reasons. Comments that are just obvious trolling, spam or repeats may also be removed without notice.

What this means is that you might not notice if your comment is removed. The best way to avoid this is to not violate the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in the first place, but if you have any doubt, you can also check the public mod logs.

**Public mod logs**

In the interest of transparency, moderation logs are public on r/NeutralPolitics. We have [our own system](https://modlogs.fyi/r/NeutralPolitics) (there's also a link in the sidebar) or you can use [ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics).

Knowing sometimes it can be hard to accurately summarize someones legal position I looked at his actual [dissent](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf). In it he argues the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rule is inconsequential for two reasons, of which the second reason I am interested about. 

> Second and in the alternative, the net neutrality rule
> violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Under
> the Supreme Court’s landmark decisions in Turner

The two [mentioned](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/180/) [rulings](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/622/) as far as I can tell relate to cable providers being required to air [locally licensed stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC)

> Turner I established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In Turner II the court decided that the must carry provisions were constitutional.

I guess he is referencing the fact television companies were first amendment speakers but if he is saying the FCC cant apply the 1934 communication act because the internet is not ""radio"" how can he apply case law from the supreme court on a ruling about cable? If anything it would seem to me the internet is more analogous to radio than T.V.?
> Here, because Congress never passed net neutrality

Additionally based on the following text (mostly the editorial discretion part) I think he may be referencing [Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald_Publishing_Co._v._Tornillo) 
> In short, although the briefs and commentary about the

> infringes on the Internet service providers’ **editorial
> discretion**

which ruled 

> Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case that overturned a Florida state law requiring newspapers to allow equal space in their newspapers to political candidates in the case of a political editorial or endorsement content. The court held that while the statute does not ""prevent [newspapers] from saying anything [they] wish"" it ""exacts a penalty on the basis of the content."" Because newspapers are economically finite enterprises, ""editors may conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy,"" thereby chilling speech. Furthermore, the Court held the exercise of **editorial judgment** is a protected First Amendment activity. In effect, this ruling reaffirmed the constitutional principle of freedom of the press (detailed in the First Amendment) and prevented state governments from controlling the content of the press

Again why is a supreme court ruling on newspapers being applied as case law to the internet? Does that require some interpretation of the supreme courts intention that he seems to imply in his own dissent he cannot do?

> To state the obvious, the Supreme Court could

The United States is special in that it also claims [foreign income](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work) as taxable, but only when the profits are repatriated to the USA.

Large multinationals have developed convoluted structures to avoid paying taxes on foreign profits, like the well-publicized [Double Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement), where a set of nested sub-corporations across USA, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Bermuda pay royalties on intellectual property to each other.

455,7j50ps,False,None,336,[META] Seeking user feedback on insults directed at public figures,NeutralPolitics,"We've had some internal discussions around this as a mod team, and want to get some user feedback around whether we should prohibit comments which contain insults/name calling directed at public figures.

In particular this came up around a comment calling Donald Trump a cheeto.  We had similar issues around a John Oliver related browser extension which replaced the word ""Trump"" with ""Drumpf.""

There are other public figures subject to namecalling too, and any policy would relate to other public figures equally.  Quantity wise though, people talk about the President of the United States far more than any other public figure.

One issue to consider is how to deal with insults directed at public figures which may be factually justified.  E.g. if one wants to call a political figure a liar based on sources showing that they're knowingly saying things which are not true, we wouldn't want to ban that.

Under our current rules, the general consensus has been that a comment which otherwise complies with the rules would not break a rule by using an insult directed at a public figure, but would if insulting another user.  A submission which used an insult against would violate the rule against neutral framing.

Should this policy change?  If so, what specific ideas for a new policy would you suggest?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7j50ps/meta_seeking_user_feedback_on_insults_directed_at/,497,"Hello from r/NeutralNews

I've had run ins with the mods about calling the current president colorful names.

Personally, I think that name calling public figures is a type of shorthand that allows me to succinctly communicate facts and opinions about a person in question.  I could call trump a proto-fascist that abuses spray tan, or I could get refer to him as Cheeto Benito.  I think that the community voting should be used to regulate name calling public figures and not hard rules.

Based on the distraction that name calling causes, I've stopped; but I would like to have the option for when I feel it's appropriate. ",2017-12-11 20:26:37

Are these elements of a trial that are so fundamental to the proceedings, that they should be accepted out of hand? (And/or there are other fundamental elements of a trial that were skipped that should also be deemed necessary?)

Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence? Are there advantages or intention behind the current vagueness of the procedures as outlined in the Constitution?

Should there be an amendment to the constitution that codifies this process and implements more standards, for example [more closely resembling criminal trial procedure](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part2/chapter223&edition=prelim)?

What are the potential downsides of this idea? EG: does this give the Chief Justice too much say in what witnesses and evidence gets allowed? Inconsistencies in going by criminal proceedings in a venue where there is no [well-defined criminal code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part1&edition=prelim)?

&#x200B;

I don't think that is an accurate telling of the current impeachment.  Should the Senate vote on the impeachment articles as voted on in the house? is a better question.  The role of the senate is not to investigate, that is the SOLE responsibility of the house.  During the clinton impeachment, the only witnesses called had already provided testimony to either the house investigation, or the special counsel.  There were no NEW witnesses. As far as the Schumer line of ""no witnesses, and no documents"" there were over 22k documents submitted for consideration, as well as the house [Report](https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20191216/CRPT-116hrpt346.pdf).  But what is interesting, is Schiff has not released the testimony of one [Last Witness](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/23/michael-atkinson-testimony-concealed-adam-schiff/) from the investigation, Attkinson.   So if there is no witnesses or documents, then the house should not have voted on their articles of impeachment, because the senate is trying the case as presented by the house through the articles.  Not to mention the white house counsel was not allowed to cross examine 14 of the 18 witnesses, which on its face seems wildly inappropriate to the accused.

So I think a more neutral interpretation is, is it the responsibility of the trying body or the investigative body to conduct that portion of the impeachment?  

&#x200B;

My view is the senate should be trying the case as voted on in the house, and should not be used to complete the investigation the house chose not to, because in the case of Bolton, they KNEW they wanted him.  he is not a new player to the investigation, the house did not pursue the avenues available to them in getting Bolton to testify.

459,7m1680,False,None,160,What do we know about the treatment of Hezbollah by the Obama administration near the time of the Iran deal?,NeutralPolitics,"Politico reports that the DEA launched an investigation into Hezbollah in 2008, called Project Cassandra, and has evidence that Hezbollah is now a international crime syndicate that ""collects $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.""

[Politico reports that](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/):

>When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.

>The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah’s high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.

David Asher, a Defense Department illicit finance expert who worked on Project Cassandra, said about the decisions which hindered the project: 

>""This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision. They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.""

John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director wrote that:

>“the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries” through not only a direct dialogue, but “greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon’s political system.”

Why would Brennan want Hezbollah to have more political power?

In 2010, Reuters reported that at a conference in Washington, Brennan said:

>“Hezbollah is a very interesting organization,” Brennan told a Washington conference, citing its evolution from “purely a terrorist organization” to a militia to an organization that now has members within the parliament and the cabinet.

>“There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they’re doing. And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements,” Brennan said.

Ali Fayad, A Lebanese arms dealer ""who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles"" was arrested in Prague in 2014. He was in custody for 2 years, but

>top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.

>He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.

Katherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that

>“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”

Politico adds to this by reporting:

>As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

David Asher said that

>“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”

After the Iran deal was put into place,

>within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

>As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:

>“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”

>“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”

>>His solution, recently laid out in a speech at the UN General Assembly, is to carve out a large buffer zone along Syria’s border with Turkey. The area would be 300 miles long and 20 miles deep, under Turkish control, and off-limits to Kurdish forces. According to Erdogan, this “safe zone” would host two million to three million refugees, thus ridding Ankara of a major domestic headache. It would boast 200,000 homes, along with hospitals, football pitches, mosques, and schools, Turkish-built but financed internationally—a setup that would provide much-needed revenue for Turkey’s struggling construction sector at a time of economic downturn.

It sounds like there are three outcomes trying to be achieved.
1/ Relocation of refugees who are becoming a difficult problem for domestic politics
2/ Undermine the possibility of creation of a Kurdish state
3/ Provide economic stimulus to the domestic construction industry through construction projects funded by the international community (nobody has agreed to that but I guess they will try to bargain for it)

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as ""the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle.""

Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.

That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently.

I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.

So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on: 

 - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**
 - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**
 - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;** 
 - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**

I'm still not sure why Sanders didn't call for a recount in Iowa since the vote was so close. 49.9 to 49.6 percent. Maybe because Hillary would have walked away with more superdelegates anyways.

And there is evidence of MSM promoting and protecting Hillary while ignoring, mocking and helping to mislead people about Bernie so you should really be skeptical when it comes to MSM.

484,8w87j9,False,None,83,Denaturalization in the United States,NeutralPolitics,"**TLDR: How have we gotten from Justice Black's rejection of ""fleeting citizenship"" to the current set of laws being enforced by the USCIS?** 

[The USCIS has started a denaturalization task force](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/uscis-starting-denaturalization-task-force/) with the intent of finding ""U.S. citizens they say should not have been naturalized, to revoke their citizenship, and then eventually deport them.""

As I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but [*Trop v. Dulles,* 356 U.S. 86 (1958)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1956/70), has yet to be overturned. Within the case, section 401(g) of the amended 1940 Nationality Act (which authorized the expatriation of Albert L. Trop after he was convicted for desertion during wartime) was found unconstitutional on 8th Amendment grounds, thus implying that a person can't have their citizenship revoked from them as punishment for a crime.

Earlier in that year though [*Perez v. Brownell*, 356 US 44 (1958)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1957/44) affirmed that Congress did have the right to revoke a native-born American of their citizenship, especially given the circumstances of the case (as Clemente Perez didn't abide by the Selective Service laws in place during WWII, and also spent much of his life in his ancestral home of Mexico, even voting in Mexican elections).

However, 9 years later in [*Afroyim v. Rusk*, 387 U.S. 253 (1967)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/456), which has yet to be overturned, the Court reversed *Perez* in a 6-4 opinion, where Justice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, said the following: 

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States...."" There is no indication in these words of a fleeting citizenship, good at the moment it is acquired but subject to destruction by the Government at any time. Rather the Amendment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it. Once acquired, this Fourteenth Amendment citizenship was not to be shifted, canceled, or diluted at the will of the Federal Government, the States, or any other governmental unit.

HOWEVER, despite all of this, the USCIS states on [their official website](https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartL-Chapter2.html), that a person can be stripped of their citizenship if a person either ""Procures Naturalization Illegally"", during the naturalization process ""misrepresents or conceals some fact ... willfully"", ""becomes a member of, or affiliated with, the Communist party, other totalitarian party, or terrorist organization within five years of his or her naturalization"", or dissociates from the US Military for any reason ""other than Honorable Discharge before Five Years of Honorable Service after Naturalization"" (if that person had naturalized on the basis of honorable service to the US armed forces).

There are a few links on the website, but it's 2 AM and I won't lie, I'm really struggling to understand the disconnect between the law and these court cases. If anybody could please tell me what's going on here I'd really appreciate it. Were any of these court cases overturned? Was no case overturned fully, but was Justice Black's interpretation of the 14th Amendment severely diminished by another legal rule put forward by a future case? Are lower court judges refusing to uphold these cases?

> The National Emergencies Act (NEA) establishes certain expedited procedures that Congress may use to terminate a declaration of national emergency, which are set forth at 50 U.S.C. § 1622(c). When a joint resolution terminating a national emergency is introduced in either chamber, it is referred to an appropriate committee, which is obligated to report it out with any recommendations within 15 calendar days. The House or Senate is then obligated to vote on the proposal within three calendar days. If one chamber passes a resolution, it is then passed to the other chamber, where the same basic procedures apply. If the two chambers pass different versions of a joint resolution, then a conference committee is obligated to file a compromise report within six days, which then must be voted on within an additional six days. If they cannot come to agreement, they must report that back within 48 hours. **The net effect of these procedures is to ensure that joint resolutions to terminate national emergencies will receive at least some manner of vote (procedural or substantive) in both chambers, regardless of the preferences of House or Senate leadership or any filibusters by Senate members.**

From there, President Trump will have the option to Veto the resolution, which would send it back to the House and Senate where 2/3 majorities in both chambers will be required to overrule Trump's veto (from 2nd source):

> ...a joint resolution ending a national emergency is still subject to a veto by the president.

> ...a presidential veto of a joint resolution can be overridden only by two-thirds of both chambers of Congress.

A Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration is an exception to the general rules.

The two *typical* ways a [vote is brought to the Senate are](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20668.pdf) (PDF warning):

> (1) The Senate, at the majority leader’s request, grants unanimous consent to take up a matter.

>  (2) it agrees to his motion to proceed to consider it. Because the motion to proceed is subject to debate in most circumstances, it is less frequently used.

----

This leaves me very confused about what rules dictate a forced vote in the Senate when the President vetos a Joint Resolution to overturn an Emergency Declaration. For example, if a Joint Resolution passes in the House and Senate, the President vetos that JR, does the Senate *have* to vote on overruling that veto?

I have two questions:

1: Does the Senate *have* to hold votes on overturning a Presidential veto? Is there anything different about a Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration that would force a vote on overturning *that* Presidential veto?

2: If there is a dispute as to whether or not the chamber is forced to vote, how is that conflict resolved? 

---

**Edit: If I could add this question:**

**This Joint Resolution, should it be passed in the House, seems like a fairly unique procedure to force a Senate floor vote. Are there any other odd procedures relating to any topic that would force a Senate floor vote like this?**
",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/as4tc4/the_senate_generally_has_the_right_to_decide_for/,478,"Barring a judicial order, I don't think the Senate has to schedule a vote on the Joint Resolution, even though the Act specifically states that it does, because it's impossible to enforce with Mitch McConnell as the Majority Whip.  He's already clarified his support (or possible indifference) for President Trump's invocation of executive emergency powers through the National Emergencies Act.^[1](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-border-wall-presidential-powers-trump-national-emergency-0218-20190215-story.html)  

>Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution is unequivocal: ""No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."" But, according to reports, Trump will spend around $8 billion for a barrier at the border, only $1.375 billion of which is in Congress's new budget deal. That's something the late, great Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., would never have choked down. **McConnell, on the other hand, already said that he is willing to swallow it.**

The Senate will vote on whatever bill the majority leader and other senior party members permit on the floor, which stems from the Senate's own rules of procedure^[2](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/floor_leaders.htm) and their traditional unwritten legislative precedent.  Both houses are constitutionally permitted to establish their own rules of procedure.^[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Rules)  The Senate and House of Representatives intermittently attempted to establish joint rules of operation, but gave up by 1889, opting instead to rely on provisions of legislation or informal understandings (legislative precedent).^[4](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Getting_Together_-_Joint_Rules_of_House_and_Senate.htm)  The threshold for a successful Congressional Veto of a Presidential Veto is two-thirds of both houses of Congress, and according to *INS v Chadha*^[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Naturalization_Service_v._Chadha), the bicameralism principle of the Constitution cannot be altered legislatively in such a manner as to sidestep that threshold; therefore, I suspect the House and Senate would both be required to vote if Congress wishes to overturn the Presidential Veto of the Joint Resolution with a Congressional one.  The Senate cannot act on behalf of the House of Representatives to overturn a Presidential Veto by itself because it's a separate institution with different responsibilities; neither chamber possesses the constitutional authority or even statutory means to formally punish each other individually.  Due in no small part to Mitch McConnell's support of President Trump's emergency declaration pursuant to existing law, I doubt the Senate will ever (even if it's politically pressured by the House) agree to a Congressional Veto.  From there, if a suit (or suits) follow, many legal questions will arise and perhaps the constitutionality of Trump's emergency declaration won't be discussed at all.     

>As identified in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), a political question may arise when any one of the following circumstances is present:
""a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or **a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it**; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.""^[6](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep369/usrep369186/usrep369186.pdf) [*see page 217*].

If any one of the above categories are met, the courts might determine the issue to be nonjusticiable, which would end their involvement.  I don't see how they could resolve the Joint Resolution problem by creating a manageable standard because, apart from both Houses agreeing to passing a J.R pursuant with their respective rules, the Senate could simply refuse to do this.  As per the National Emergencies Act of 1976^[7](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg1255.pdf):

>(4) In the case of any disagreement between the two Houses of Congress with respect to a ~~concurrent resolution~~ joint resolution passed by both Houses, conferees shall be promptly appointed and the committee of conference shall make and file a report with respect to such concurrent resolution within six calendar days after the day on which managers on the part of the Senate and the House have been appointed. Notwithstanding any rule in either House concerning the printing of conference reports or concerning any delay in the consideration of such reports, such report shall be acted on by both Houses not later than six calendar days after the conference report is filed in the House in which such report is filed first. In the event the conferees are unable to agree within forty-eight hours, they shall report back to their respective Houses in disagreement.
(5) Paragraphs (l)-(4) of this subsection, subsection (b) of this section, and section 502(b) of this Act are enacted by Congress-- 
(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the House in the case of resolutions described by this subsection; and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and (B) with **full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House)** at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House... 

In the original Act, they utilized a concurrent resolution because that requires only Congressional approval notwithstanding the President's approval or disapproval (meaning that the President cannot veto it), but because C.R's lack the force of law, Congress can't terminate a national emergency with one. National Emergencies made pursuant to existing law [particularly when one considers *INS v Chadha*] necessitate a joint resolution; thus, they altered the law and replaced the words concurrent with joint.^[8](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-99/pdf/STATUTE-99-Pg405.pdf#page=44)

>**Bills:** The principal vehicle employed by lawmakers for introducing their proposals (enacting or repealing laws, for example) in the Senate. Bills are designated S. 1, S. 2, and so on depending on the order in which they are introduced. They address either matters of general interest (""public bills"") or narrow interest (""private bills"").
**Joint Resolution:** Designated ""S. J. Res."" and numbered consecutively upon introduction, with one exception it requires the approval of both chambers and is submitted (just as a bill) to the president for possible signature into law. The one exception is that joint resolutions are used to propose constitutional amendments. These resolutions require a two-thirds affirmative vote in each house but are not submitted to the president; they become effective when ratified by three-quarters of the States.
**Concurrent Resolution:** Designated ""S. Con. Res."" and numbered consecutively upon introduction is generally employed to address the sentiments of both chambers, to deal with issues or matters affecting both houses, or to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not submitted to the president and thus do not have the force of law.^[9](https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/d_three_sections_with_teasers/bills.htm)

I'm of the opinion that, in the event of a conflict between both houses regarding a vote, politics is the only solution.

Here is some history to ground the discussion:

Chavez' reign from 98-2007 was largely marked by increased political participation (in particular by marginilised groups)

and ambitious social programmes  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian\_missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_missions) .

&#x200B;

However after 07 a string of nationalisations took place:  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-nationalizations/factbox-venezuelas-nationalizations-under-chavez-idUSBRE89701X20121008](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-election-nationalizations/factbox-venezuelas-nationalizations-under-chavez-idUSBRE89701X20121008).

&#x200B;

The economy became even more dependent on oil, which now makes up 98% of the value of their exports: [https://www.opec.org/opec\_web/en/about\_us/171.htm](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm).

&#x200B;

Maduro was elected after Chavez' death and just as Oil prices were crashing. This put the economy into turmoil and Maduro has become increasingly authoritarian winning his second term in a highly questionable election   [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-factbox/factbox-venezuelas-jailed-exiled-or-barred-opposition-politicians-idUSKBN1FC2OG](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-factbox/factbox-venezuelas-jailed-exiled-or-barred-opposition-politicians-idUSKBN1FC2OG)

The US has levied sanctions against Venezuelans from 2013-2017 followed by sanctions against the country beginning in Aug. 2017

[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF10715.pdf)

&#x200B;

Mark Weisbrot and Jeffrey Sachs have stated that US sanctions are responsible for 40000 deaths along with other damage:  [http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf](http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf) .

&#x200B;

So my question is whether foreign (US, non-Venezuelan) actions were significant contributors to the crisis or if the majority of the blame falls on the Venezuelan government itself?

While, undoubtedly NFL teams have the right to dictate player behavior on (and off) the field, this right seems to have been complicated by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's actions and words. 

http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20961541/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-says-player-disrespects-flag-play

There is evidence that President Trump is attempting to influence/encourage/suggest a change in NFL policy, per twitter @realDonaldTrump:

>Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912080538755846144?lang=en

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/911904261553950720?lang=en

This week Vice President Mike Pence publicly left an NFL football game after members of the 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.  This would appear to be a direct escalation and encouragement of Trump's above tweet encouraging a public boycott.  

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/08/vice-president-mike-pence-leaves-colts-49ers-game-after-players-reportedly-kneel.html

There are also reports that President Trump called Jerry Jones 4 times the previous week, urging the owner 'not to allow his players to kneel' during the national anthem. 

http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353362-trump-called-cowboys-jerry-jones-four-times-asking-him-not-to-kneel 

 So, supposing a Cowboy player is punished next week for failing to express 'adequate' respect for the flag, what are the legal implications in terms of First Amendment rights?  Can we trace a clear path from the President's words to a private citizen's punishment?  At what point does pressure (on the part of the federal government through Trump's public advocacy) reach coercion?

To whit,  he has discussed his [Mars colonization](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elon-musk-publishes-plans-for-colonizing-mars/) ambitions as [part-and-parcel](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/elon-musk-colonize-mars/) with his somewhat cataclysmic view of how AI will manifest itself in the future:

>Musk’s alarming views on the dangers of A.I. first went viral after he spoke at M.I.T. in 2014—speculating (pre-Trump) that A.I. was probably humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” He added that he was increasingly inclined to think there should be some national or international regulatory oversight—anathema to Silicon Valley—“to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” He went on: “With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon. You know all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he’s like, yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.” Some A.I. engineers found Musk’s theatricality so absurdly amusing that they began echoing it. When they would return to the lab after a break, they’d say, “O.K., let’s get back to work summoning.”

I'd like to set [parameters](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Teachers/riskuncertainty.html) for this conversation by distinguishing between *risk* and *uncertainty*:

>**[Risk]** is present when future events occur with measurable probability
>
>**[Uncertainty]** is present when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable

I'm doing this because, while I appreciate the possibility that machines could learn to do bad things or have unintended consequences, I'd like to stay away from the realm of Killer Robot Santa unless we have a data set to extrapolate there.

Bearing this framework in mind:

1. What risks does AI pose to humanity, whether our well-being or more pedestrian issues like job transformations and mechanical snafus?

2. What data do we have to determine these are risks and not simply uncertainties?

3. How can we use this data to consider if government responses (e.g., regulation, investment, criminalization) to these risks are appropriate, and what might those solutions be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6sf8ei/what_are_the_real_risks_of_artificial/,470,[removed] ,2017-08-08 17:59:15

**5:42 PM EST** Welcome to the 2018 /r/NeutralPolitics election night megathread!  I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. 

**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  

**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.

**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)

**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.

**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).

**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.

**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.

**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.

**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).

**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.

**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)

**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.

**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.

**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, 

**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.

**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.

**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)

**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.

**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).

**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.

**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.

**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.

**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)

**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.

**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?

**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.

**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.

**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.

**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)

**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)

**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)

**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)

**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.

**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.

As the New York Times describes:](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

>Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.

>Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges. He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.”



I was wondering how this compares to past campaign finance issues Presidents and candidates have had.  In particular, I found [this article](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/obama-2008-campaign-fined-375000-085784) and [this article](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/07/obama-campaign-fined-big-for-hiding-donors-keeping-illegal-donations) about excess donations to the Obama campaign in 2012, and wanted to know what was similar or different about that case, or other past cases like this?

I really want to pin down the meaning of ""Basic Human Rights"". I'm posting this in a few different subreddits to get different viewpoints.

508,6ohgoj,False,None,37,What evidence exists to support the claim that the long-term benefit of repatriation of American manufacturing outweighs the immediate higher costs and will spur higher growth?,NeutralPolitics,"Yesterday Peter Navarro (the White House Trade Council director) [was on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/538148732/white-house-trade-council-director-touts-made-in-america-week), making an argument for the repatriation of American manufacturing.  I'm going to take this point by point here:

>NAVARRO: Well, I think you start with the idea that we've had 15 years of subpar growth - 2 percent or below. Prior to 2001, we grew at 3 and a half percent. The big difference has been the entry of China in particular into the World Trade Organization and our markets. And we've just been hammered. What that does as a proxy basically is it drains essentially the lifeblood out of our manufacturing economy, out of our communities, out of our tax bases.

The first part of this statement [may be an exaggeration](https://www.thebalance.com/us-gdp-by-year-3305543), but [one study](https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/china-paper.pdf) suggests that:

>Conservatively, it [rising Chinese import competition] explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets.

However, [other economists dispute](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21718513-china-shock-has-not-been-debunked-it-worth-understanding) at least some of these claims, arguing that studying the effects of extra Chinese supply  in isolation rather than in conjunction with something happening in America over-inflates the purported effect on the labor market.  Still [others argue](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19376.pdf) that the net welfare benefit to the US of stopping free trade with China would roughly be equal to the benefit gained by cheaper Chinese imports.

**Is the US-Chinese Trade deficit a significant factor in the decline of American manufacturing & growth?  Is it balanced by the benefit of cheaper imported goods for consumers?**

Navarro further goes on to assert that:

>What's interesting is that with every different country that we have a large trade deficit with, we have a different set of problems - with Mexico, for example - cheap labor. With Germany, they have a misaligned currency. So if you address these issues of unfair trade practices, if you get better trade deals, if you stop things like forced technology transfer or the theft of our intellectual property, if you ensure that the sweatshops of the world live up to international standards for minimum wage and safe working conditions, if you have reasonable environmental protection, then American manufacturers can compete with anybody in the world.

This is a very broad set of issues.  Focusing on worker compensation, the [Fair Labor Association states](http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/toward_fair_compensation_in_global_supply_chains_2016_report_only_0.pdf) reports that even when there are no legal violations in pay for workers in third world countries, the ""purchasing power of the current legal [wage] minimum falls below or near the World Bank poverty line"".  Additionally, the US has several trade agreements with [legally enforceable environmental protections](https://www.state.gov/e/oes/eqt/trade/).  My question here is:

**What measures currently exist to correct inequalities (wages/labor, environmental, intellectual property, etc.) between US manufacturers and those abroad and are they enforceable?**

Further, **what further protections would be necessary to enable ""American manufacturers to compete with anybody in the world""?**

Finally, Navarro argues:

>NAVARRO: Let me give you a number of answers to that. I mean first of all, a lot of the goods that come from abroad which are, quote, ""cheaper"" basically are cheaper because state-owned enterprises have made them heavily subsidized by their government, and they're dumped into our markets. Number two, if you look at this as a movie rather than a snapshot and you buy American in our government procurement policy - let's say it costs a little bit more - but what do you get for that?
...
What I'm saying is that if something looks like it costs a little more just 'cause it's made in America, when you cost it all out the benefits over time far outweigh the costs. Think about this. Over the last 15 years what has been the cost of buying all those cheap goods? We've lost trillions in terms of our tax base, and we put millions of people out of work.

The [Harvard business review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-chinese-subsidies-changed) supports the first part of Navarro's statement:

>In the Chinese industries we studied — solar, steel, glass, paper, and auto parts — labor was between 2% and 7% of production costs, and imported raw materials and energy accounted for most costs. Production mostly came from small companies that possessed no scale economies. Yet, Chinese products routinely sold for 25% to 30% less than those from the U.S. or European Union.

>We found that Chinese companies could do this only because of subsidies they received from China’s central and provincial governments. The subsidies took the form of free or low-cost loans; artificially cheap raw materials, components, energy, and land; and support for R&D and technology acquisitions.

>Since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, subsidies have annually financed over 20% of the expansion of the country’s manufacturing capacity. The state has willingly paid the price of economic inefficiency to accomplish political, social, economic, and diplomatic goals. Huge Chinese subsidies have led to massive excess global capacity, increased exports, and depressed worldwide prices, and have hollowed out other countries’ industrial bases.

as does the [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-importance-of-chinese-subsidies/), but further states:

>The harm is usually identified as large-scale U.S. imports from China. In fact, the main problems are barriers to American exports to the PRC and, perhaps soon, a growing battle in third markets. For the last decade, Beijing has acted as if competition is good for everyone except Chinese firms on their home turf.

**Does the current evidence suggest that imports of subsidized foreign goods are laregly responsible for slowing American growth, or is the problem instead barriers to American exports (or both/neither)?**

**Would the benefits of policies to protect American manufacturing indeed outweigh the increased costs of goods?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6ohgoj/what_evidence_exists_to_support_the_claim_that/,468,"A lot of the discussion here fails to take into enough account of the effects of supply & demand. If we bring fidget spinners (or any cheap Chinese product) back to the US, they don't stop making them. We put fidget spinners on the global market for 25% more. Do we think even our own people are suddenly going to be cool with it? It means we buy less crappy stuff. We can argue that it makes the world a better place, but it doesn't make us any more competitive. ",2017-07-20 16:43:25

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), no incumbent lost their primary in any of these three states. 47 districts/seats in total were up for grabs.

By my count, no Democratic candidate filed to run in 13 districts, and no Republican filed to run in 4 districts.

In addition, in 21 districts only one Democrat was on the ballot (uncontested), and in 19 districts only one Republican was on the ballot (uncontested). By the other way of looking at it, there were competitive primary races in only 13 Democratic districts (28%), and 24 Republican Districts (51%).

Come November, seven districts will be entirely uncontested because only one candidate will be on the general election ballot (three districts had candidates who waltz into the House with no opposition at any point whatsoever).

however i think the anti-establishment sentiment, or any nationally trending political fad carries only over ""celebrity"" politics. a president has the most individual power a politican can have, voting for a president is the most popular part of the political process, gets most media attention and consequently the most discussion. i infer that people who vote for presidents and not congresspeople do so because they get the idea that since the president has the most power, they don't 'need' to vote for any other position. sort of like a quasi- trickle down politics. so no matter which political movement is trending it is unlikely to see it reflected on a local or state scale since all the focus is on changing the white house. 

from what i gather, bernie's #politicalrevolution can only start to happen after bernie hypothetically gets elected. from his position as president he would be able to consistently reach out to America for political change. as a candidate, only berners will stick to that message. it is unlikely to happen without his presidency and somewhat more likely if he is president, but he would still face the obstacle of people only paying attention to celebrity politics

I doubt it. Weren't a large chunk of Republicans social democrats during the Cold War? It was only until Reagan's successful play for the Moral Majority that won him the election, which finally secured the Christian rightwing presence in American politics, that saw the dissolution of the social democrat politician.

I'd like to hear your best arguments!

I think the reason is that because a social democrat candidate, like Sanders, is so unusual, it is a sign that, since Reagan's presidency -- when the US' political landscape has become so skewed towards religious conservatism and, increasingly, corporate socialism -- politicians who claim to be leftist are actually rightwing, centrist at best. Sanders represents the growing discontent at nearly 40 years of this constant adoration of conservatism and cynicism.

The current liberalised youth are comparing the US to other developed economies, good and bad, and have been taking measure. They -- and maybe even their parents -- have not known a social democrat America. They've only known George Bush Jr's organ-grinder crusade in the Middle East and a selection of massively out-of-tune Republican candidates promising ghastly American theocracies. The democrats are winning but it's not because they have a great platform but because they are just ""not the Republican Party"". Just as Republican's abandoned the Bush Sr/Quayle to vote for Bill Clinton in 1992, so too are the democrats going to win because the dissonance of Trump's reality TV presidential campaign is forcing Republican voters to vote Hillary in. These are people who thought Cruz was the better candidate.

But nonetheless, Trump let the investigation continue once he was given more information regarding the matter.

My question, in the title, is something that is being hotly debated on every single news channel and in every debate circle. Does obstruction of justice need the actual act carried out to completion?

My questions are about the norms of firing for cause at the Federal level:

* The IG's report outlines four incidents of violation of FBI policy, but doesn't recommend what should be done with McCabe. Was his firing for lack of candor within established norms, even considering his long history with the bureau?

Is it unusual for a President to recommend the AG fire a specific person at the FBI, even one who is not currently working at the bureau?
* Is it common that the IG would provide the report to the Attorney General so far in advance of providing it to Congress and the public? Is there evidence that the report was rushed to the powers that be in order to beat the clock on McCabe's pending retirement?

533,c1z103,False,None,15,"How has ""Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act"" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?",NeutralPolitics,"Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.

Questions:

1. Were these genuine problems in boxing at the time of the Ali Act's passage?

2. Are these less of a problem now?

4. Has enforcement of the Ali Act been effective?

5. General question: What have we learned about combat sports regulation with the benefit of 19 years of hindsight?

6. Are these a real problem in MMA now?

7. What are some potential downsides of expanding the Ali Act to include MMA?

American elections pose a challenge in that typically many offices are elected at the same time.  In many countries, the possibility of [snap elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election) means that there is no opportunity to coordinate multiple elections on the same day.

The US' [fixed election dates](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7) allow that states and local governments can run elections scheduled to be voted on at the same time, which is why [Broward County Florida](https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/7/74/Florida_sample_ballot_%28Broward_County%29.pdf) used a 9 page long ballot with 39 separate voting opportunities on it.

Hear me out: instead of a ballot you get a fob that has a UUID that represents your transaction on the chain. You vote using that identifier. 

Because it's a public ledger, the vote count is tabulated in real time and is publicly accessible. You can use your UUID at any time to make sure your vote was registered correctly and hasn't been changed. 

You can get a paper receipt which ties the UUID to your vote so that if you do see a discrepancy you have a record to challenge that record and enter your UUID into a challenged bucket which would also provide evidence of fraud.

The polling locations would all have to verify and agree to accept into the chain the votes as they come in, but the machines in the network could do this too, with each machine being a node. 

You could even have two copies of a receipt: one for a hand count and one to send home with the user, all tied to a UUID.

Because the UUID isn't tied to your registration in any way, and because the people that usually verify your registration would still be doing this, this could be a drop in replacement for how the US holds it's elections now.

This would require internet access to verify the votes and add them to the chain in real time, so it may not be feasible in more rural areas.

547,7ihkgn,False,None,27,Should antitrust law and enforcement focus more on vertical integration?,NeutralPolitics,"Net neutrality is the hot topic of the day but another issue at hand is antitrust. Amazon in particular has come under scrutiny after its [acquisition of Whole Foods Market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/16/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-market-in-deal-valued-at-13-7-billion-2/?utm_term=.81d2c0921199).

(Full disclosure: I work for Amazon but am obviously posting here in a private capacity.)

Historically, antitrust law has focused on horizontal monopolies, i.e., one firm cornering an entire market by crowding out competitors at the same stage of production. Vertical integration, in contrast, focuses more on owning the entirety of your upstream or downstream production chain. This is an oversimplification but is fine for the purpose of a high level conversation.

In the case of Amazon, acquiring Whole Foods gives them control of grocery distribution to supply their Fresh delivery system. To use another example, [look at the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730906-vertical-integration-could-put-brake-americas-unsustainably-soaring-health-care-costs):

>The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers. If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of United’s pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.

Non-specific tidbits on the [argument in favor](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696911-tech-fashion-old-management-idea-back-vogue-vertical-integration-gets-new) of vertical consolidation:

- Better integrated products (i.e., creating an ecosystem in which it is easier to get everything you need in one space);
- Efficiency of doing things in-house;
- Building customer relationships (via integration and the subsequent creation of frictionless consumer experiences)
- Speed and efficiency from owning your entire production process;
- Minimizing risk across uncertain geopolitical space

The trade-off in this is the potential reduction of consumer choice and ""boxing in"" of customer behavior (see: [Vox's analysis](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2017/12/4/16731310/cvs-aetna-merger) of the Aetna/CVS merger for examples). Likewise, we can see privacy concerns, such as tech ecosystems that collect data in one capacity to inform another (e.g., Amazon using Whole Foods to collect customer behavior data to hone their advertisement algorithms).

Moreover, the reason why I mentioned net neutrality is because implicit in that argument is a concern over information limitation and throttling, but we can see examples of this with firms that own downstream production and content. Using Amazon as an example again, we have [historical examples](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0) of the company deprioritizing book search results related to a publishing dispute. Today, Amazon and Google are in a spat that has resulted in the [loss of Youtube functionality](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices) across Amazon devices.

Thus there is significant control over content here, at least in so far as we have a major player in one market able to influence an area where they have a smaller share but nevertheless major influence on access to a good or service. This is a particularly acute concern where that influence is tethered to a medium or platform with a strong correlation to information dissemination, such as vieo.

The additional historical justification for antitrust law has been the argument that it's bad for consumers, typically by limiting their choice to a single firm that has significant price control. The traditional metrics have been market share and pricing.

But how should we evaluate vertical integration if: (1) it doesn't usually increase market share that much (e.g., Amazon still accounts for very little of the grocery market post-Whole Foods acquisition); (2) arguably it creates a better environment for consumers who want fast and frictionless goods/services, and; (3) we have yet to come up with a strong corollary for market share and price controls as the metrics for ""too much""?

Specific questions:

- Should this be policed more explicitly and increased rigor?
- What are the measurements by which we determine vertical integration has exceeded an appropriate threshold?
- Arguably this is more of a concern across data collection and communication areas. Is this less an antitrust concern and more of a communications and data security matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7ihkgn/should_antitrust_law_and_enforcement_focus_more/,442,"While vertical mergers may not raise prices for consumers there are political concerns raised by antitrust that should also be considered. Vertical mergers can significantly expand the economic power of a corporation in a given sector. I.e. Aetna acquiring CVS in healthcare, Disney acquiring Marvel in entertainment, and Amazon acquiring Whole Foods in retail. Substantial economic power allows corporations to pursue rent seeking activities like lobbying. 

Thus, political power follows economic power. It seems to me that regardless of consumer prices, whether we deem the consolidation of economic and political power in large corporations a political good is of central concern. One concern I have is that corporations are accountable only to shareholders while the government is accountable to the majority. This is how it ought to be. However, as corporations cross a certain threshold of economic power and rent seeking becomes inevitable the government privileges the interests of corporate shareholders over the majority. This is not how it ought to be. The question: What is that threshold?

>In interviews with a dozen diplomats, many of whom declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about anything related to the next U.S. president, some said spending money at Trump’s hotel is an easy, friendly gesture to the new president.

Under federal law, bribery is described (in relevant part) as follows:

>Whoever directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent:

549,diryfd,False,None,206,Impeachment & Removal - Campaign Procedure/Precedent & Party Responsibilities,NeutralPolitics,"As [no President has been impeached and removed in US History](https://time.com/5552679/impeached-presidents/), I have a few questions about the process and how it would affect the GOP should it come to that:

* First, what is the precedent for past elevated VP's when it comes to running for reelection? Have they typically chosen new running mates and run as the primary candidate on the ticket, has the party nominated a new presidential candidate and they remain the VP on that ballot, or have they typically decided not to run?
* Second, what is the party's obligation in the case of removal from office, as it relates to an upcoming election? Do they have to stage primaries and debates? Or do they operate under the assumption that since the VP was chosen as the running mate, that he would be the de facto nominee? Would additional outside candidates have the chance to throw their hats in the ring?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/diryfd/impeachment_removal_campaign_procedureprecedent/,441,"There isn't really a precedent for a VP becoming president and running for presidential election.  Not by way of impeachment anyway.

[Lyndon Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson) was elevated from VP to President when JFK was assassinated.  He ran for a second term and won.

But one thing that I think is important to remember is that presidential running mates typically aren't selected because they are the second best candidate. All of the party's eggs are usually in the basket of the president and a running mate is selected for focus group reasons.  (they appeal to certain demographics and can help boost votes).

The best example that comes to mind is [Sarah Palin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin).  We later found out that John McCain did not want her as his running mate, and he didn't even interview her for the position.  She was presented to him by the party and campaign managers.  Not because she would be the most qualified to replace him, but because as a female, she could snatch up supporters of the recently defeated Hillary Clinton, and because she was very charismatic (but extremely inexperienced).  Obama was *also* very charismatic and inexperienced, so they thought she may have the same appeal.


The point I'm making is that Pence likely isn't the guy they really want as president. If he takes office and people really rally behind him, they will be forced to support him for ""re""election. 

But otherwise (this is not fact, just my best guess) I think they would probably try to find a candidate that that best counters the democratic candidate.  It would likely be late in the race and the democrats would have already shown their full hand. If one of the socialists (Warren or Sanders) are the democratic candidate, they will likely try to find someone that can capitalize on the public's fears of ""government overreach"", fear of socialism leading to communism, etc... yet mature and respected to fill in where Trump came up short. 

In other words, I think they would push a moderate, middle of the road guy to appear reasonable and make the socialist candidates appear extreme. 


If a more moderate democratic candidate like Biden or Gabbard is selected, then I think they would do the opposite.  They would probably find a more ""far right"" guy to differentiate them from the ""more reasonable"" Democratic candidate and find someone that can capitalize on Trump's supporters. 


That's my *guess*. 

Another possibility I could see, to answer your question about the actual *process* thing, is that if they foresee a good likelihood that Trump will removed, then they begin a ""parallel"" campaign.  There is no precedent for this, so I'm totally guessing here... 


But a parallel campaign that kind of mirrors Trump.  Appeals to his same followers, capitalizes on the people that feel Trump is being railroaded, etc.  Then they have this candidate at the ready if Trump is removed, but can also bow out and defer to Trump if he is *not* removed. 


The timing makes it interesting.  It (probably intentionally) is timed to put the conservatives in a bind by having the president being actively investigated during a re-election campaign. And it definitely puts them in a bind.  They are going to have to get creative with how they respond, and like many things in this presidency, we will see a lot of ""firsts"". 


I think the battle will be for how people view the investigation into Trump.  Will they see him as a crooked politician skirting responsibility?  Or will they see him as a political target being railroaded by the opposing party?   We are going to see a *massive* amount of spin from both sides to try to control this narrative. 

If Republicans, can somehow create sympathy for Trump/Pence as a victim like they had for JFK/Johnson, then maybe Pence can get the push.  But if Democrats can  sell Trump as a villain, the Pence will go down with him.  Then the party would distance themselves and go in a different direction. 

There are a lot of variables. ",2019-10-16 16:42:56

He cited 'threats' as the reason. His attorney cited 'ongoing threats'.

Cohen appears to have some Congressional support for his assertion of 'threats' by the President:

> Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — chairman of the oversight committee — and Rep. Adam Schiff of California — chairman of the intelligence committee — also echoed earlier criticism of Trump for what they suggested was obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

> ""As we stated previously with our colleague, Chairman Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, efforts to intimidate witnesses, scare their family members, or prevent them from testifying before Congress are textbook mob tactics that we condemn in the strongest terms,"" Cummings and Schiff said.

> The president’s allies in Congress dismissed the notion that his attacks constituted a threat to Mr. Cohen. “Everyone knows it wasn’t witness intimidation — c’mon,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said in a brief interview. “If he comes, we’ll be ready. If he doesn’t, he doesn’t.”

> ....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.

The President's lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani, has also participated in pointing towards Cohen's family members](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18194719/trump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat):

> In an appearance on CNN Sunday, Rudy Giuliani went even further, stating flat-out that Cohen’s father in law, “a Ukrainian,” “may have ties to something called organized crime.”

After the president's recent comments about ""it could be Russia, it could be others...we don't know"" I started digging a little further as it appears that all the reporting has been that it was most certainly Russia.


In trying to understand more I came across at least two articles related to the DNC hack which clearly state that the DNC has never allowed any outside intelligence or investigative body access to their servers -

Is there any other corroborating evidence that can be gathered outside of the server that substantiates the claims of this private company?


Is there evidence that this private company can provide that could not possibly be faked or misleading that investigators can use to make their determinations?


In regards to the Podesta emails - I have seen no stories regarding NSA, CIA, or FBI investigators reviewing the information, but I am also aware that they would most likely not comment on ongoing investigations.

It turned out, many people labeled by media in such way don't doubt the change itself, but rather extent of human influence or extent of potential negative effects. I had been mistaken by taking the meaning literally. 

So it seems there is a whole spectrum of people called denialists: from denial of any current dramatic change on the one side to impact indifference on the other (that is believing that change is happening and caused by humans and would lead to negative effects, but that these effects would be negligible in comparison to avoidance costs). As these positions cover a very broad range, is there some statistics on them for US?

However, the article later refers to the word ""sex"" instead of ""gender"" as the term that the Trump Administration is interpreting.

- Based both on its interpretation of Title IX and its other actions, to what extent is the Trump administration motivated by an earnest stricter or literal interpretation of the law, and has it shown a pattern of policies that harm LGBTQ people?

- What specific judgements has the Trump administration made regarding the definition of gender? Of sex? How are these definitions similar to or different from the medical consensus?

On the one hand, [as hunters argue](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/black-rhino-hunting-permit/index.html), sanctioned hunts can be auctioned off to raise substantial amounts of money for conservation efforts, and the ability to bring home trophies  can make this more appealing for wealthy hunters.

On the other hand, [poaching is still a significant threat to elephant populations](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/2016_trends_in_African_elephant_poaching_released_–_CITES_MIKE_programme_03032017) and legalizing the import of trophies could expand the perceived market for poachers in America, giving them further motivation.

Given that both of these arguments are at least *feasible*, if not necessarily reality, what evidence is there as to what the net effect will be on elephant populations?

Edit: Additionally, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, [trophy bans are based in part by the US determining that these countries were not adequately contributing to conservation efforts](https://www.fws.gov/international/permits/by-activity/sport-hunted-trophies-elephants.html).

For healthcare in the US, but insurance firms have low margins.

>How much do health insurers profit?
If we look average profit margins by industry, health insurance companies are pretty close to the bottom, with an overall average profit margin of just 3.3%. For perspective, the banking and real estate industries have profit margins that average over 20%, and major drug manufacturers average profit margins of nearly 22%.

>The ACA implemented MLR guidelines that require health insurance companies to spend the bulk of what they collect in premiums on medical claims. That automatically limits their administrative expenses - including executive compensation and profits - to no more than 20% of premium revenue.

>But there's no similar requirement for hospitals, device manufacturers, or drug manufacturers.

Seeing as (anecdotal statement) hopsitals can charge $100 for a single Tylenol is somewhat ridicules.

So what can be done via market solutions (or command) to reduce the costs to consumers placed on them by providers.

Now with the PSA part out of the way, I'd like to ask about the merits of automatic voter registration, whose goal is to make things like National Voter Registration Day unnecessary.

565,b1uxfi,False,None,350,What are the causes of California's housing shortage? What steps can they take to address the shortage?,NeutralPolitics,"Back in 1978, before California's housing boom, the Californian people passed [Proposition 13](https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf) which rolled back and froze property tax values to the 1976 assessed value. Property tax increases were also limited to no more than 2% per year as long as the property was not sold. When the house was sold the property was reassessed at 1% of the sale price. It now seems that with the increasing housing prices we are seeing a spike in out-migration from California, as per this study from [California's Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265), between the years 2007 to 2016 the state lost a new 1 million residents. Now despite the fact that it is now cheaper to hold onto land as opposed to selling it, and sky rocketing home prices( [With California's median home price now topping $600,000) as per the California Association of Realtors](https://www.car.org/en/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2018releases/May2018homesales)) , why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes ([as per a 2018 study from California's Housing Future: Challenges and Opportunities the amount of newly constructed homes only averaged less than 80,000 homes annually](http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/sha_final_combined.pdf))",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/b1uxfi/what_are_the_causes_of_californias_housing/,432,"> why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes

California's housing crisis is a case of demand far outstripping whatever supply can bring to bear.  Most people want to live in the LA and SF areas, as evidenced by the [gigantic sprawls](https://la.curbed.com/2014/4/3/10121264/los-angeles-sprawl-history-map-animation) that have erupted from [both places](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/31/new-report-shows-huge-gains-in-bay-area-open-space-but-nearly-300000-acres-still-at-risk/), but as one branches out the territory becomes far less desirable than the metro areas proper, which makes new construction in these areas less desirable.

What is causing the demand?  That's hard to answer.  I'm of the opinion that the combination of Silicon Valley, LA's booming port and rail industry due to pacific rim trade, and foreign buying have dramatically altered the housing costs to something less than rational for the average person looking to work and raise a family somewhere.

566,5mxy1e,False,None,73,When does a president's economic record begin?,NeutralPolitics,"I want to acknowledge at the outset that a president doesn't have sole control over the economy. There are a variety of other factors working in concert, and many have nothing to do with the president, or even government policy in general, so I'm expecting that a lot of this is just undeterminable. 

Nevertheless, every US election cycle is peppered with arguments about who to credit or blame for the state of the economy, and most of them come down to timing: Did the president inherit the problems, or were they a result of his own policies?

For example, the [dot-com bubble burst](https://worldhistoryproject.org/2000/3/13/the-market-opens-4-lower-on-monday-than-it-closed-on-friday) at the end of the Clinton administration, but GW Bush was primarily the one to deal with the fallout. In turn, the [Great Recession hit full stride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States) at the end of Bush's term, but it was mostly Obama who had to deal with that one. 

At present, we've got the president-elect receiving credit for some economic changes — such as manufacturing shifts at [Carrier](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/donald-trump-indiana-factory-jobs-carrier-mexico) and [Ford](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-thanks-ford-motor-company-233172) — before even taking office. He has also [claimed credit for a December jump in the Consumer Confidence Index.](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-soaring-consumer-confidence-thanks-donald-2016-12-28)

If it weren't for situations like those, I'd be tempted to suggest we should start assigning credit/blame when the President's [first budget takes effect,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget) which, if it is approved on time, would be October of the year of inauguration, or nearly a year after the election. Using that standard, the Obama administration has overseen continual growth in [GDP](http://imgur.com/a/DtV1c) and [employment,](http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=usurtot&v=201701061339r&d1=20070101&d2=20171231&h=300&w=600) but also the continued trend of [widening income inequality.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/america-income-inequality-wealth-net-worth-charts)

So, before the inauguration of a new president, I'd like to see if we can quantify some of this stuff. Is there a way to break down which economic policy outcomes can be attributed to which administration? Can reasonably solid causation be determined, or is any metric inherently subjective?

567,aq73o3,False,Meta,37,[META] How to write a successful submission for /r/NeutralPolitics (2019),NeutralPolitics,"In honor of the seventh birthday of /r/NeutralPolitics, the mods have asked me, a frequent poster, to make a post addressing one of the long-standing issues with submissions: most posts don’t get approved, and a few break the rules in such a way that they can’t be fixed. 

The rules for /r/NeutralPolitics are [well laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), and /u/huadpe did a great job making a [submission-tip-list last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/), but if you’re like me, you probably don’t check the rules as you're making your post, or you do so sparingly. 

So since /u/huadpe's post is so good (really the post is very specific and quite helpful - I suggest you check it out) and the rules so well laid out, I’m going to take a slightly different and more informal approach from last year: I have 3 general tips for help organizing questions and setting your expectations.

**1: Figure out who said the thing**

Whether you heard it at work/school or read it on the internet, there’s a good chance you first came across an interesting topic as:

> “The left/right/Republicans/Democrats/scientists/ a conservative think tank/ a liberal economist, said...”

As you're laying out the background for the topic in your post, start by sourcing who introduced the topic. You don't necessarily need to give a specific name in in all cases, but I find starting with sources that correctly attribute where ideas came from helps organize the question with relevant background info. Including a source with the person who said something also tells their relative position within an organization and helps assess how serious a move or statement it is. 

**2: You're asking for explanations for things on the internet**

Don’t ask for the impossible. The thing that /r/NeutralPolitics's commenters do best is synthesize multiple internet sources to provide a coherent answer to your narrow questions, but if your question doesn't require outside sources to answer, it's in the wrong place. If a poster can't answer a question with something on the internet, you might instead be seeking speculation or pure opinion from redditors.

**3: Already approved posts offer great instructions for how to frame new topics**

The subreddit's [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) does a great job covering the specifics of post submissions, but if you're still unsure about how to frame your question, simply look to recently approved posts. You can use approved posts to get a sense of how the subreddit's rules work in action, and then use the same language to frame your own question.

What is the difference, and has this happened to other elected US government offices?",NeutralPolitics,"On Friday the [NY Times broke a story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/fbi-trump-russia-inquiry.html) that the President was a part of a 'counterintelligence' investigation, separate from the obstruction investigation, which falls under a 'criminal' investigation and has long been known about.

The Times reports the counterintelligence elements were eventually folded into the criminal investigation:

> The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.

The Times notes that the FBI does two types of inquiries, broken down as:

> The F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.

It's noted that not all former law enforcement officers agree with this move: 

> A vigorous debate has taken shape among some former law enforcement officials outside the case over whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a tumultuous period at the Justice Department. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.

I have a few questions:

1: What does it mean, or what is the significance of the President being investigated on a counterintelligence level vs. a regular criminal investigation?

2: For a person being investigated, what is the difference between a criminal and counterintelligence investigation? Will you not be told you're under investigation, etc?

3: Is there any precedent for this, as in have there been other government employees or elected officials that have been targeted in counterintelligence investigations?

Today we're announcing a few small updates to the rules and procedures. Some of these were already mod policy, but hadn't been added to the official guidelines yet. Others are new.


**1. The table in the [sources section of the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) has two new lines to deal with personal blogs and tweets:**

Source type | Submissions | Comments
---|---|----
Personal blogs* | Disallowed | Permitted if the blog post links to qualified non-blog sources
Tweets | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder

This means tweets may not be used to support any assertion of fact other than a claim of attribution. For instance, a [tweet from the NeutralPolitics Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeutralPolitic/status/1022531083341058048) saying, ""NeutralPolitics has the best looking mods on all of Reddit!"" cannot be used to support assertions about the attractiveness of the mods. It can only be used to demonstrate that the NeutralPolitics mod team *stated* it has the most attractive mods (even though it happens to be true).

 \*A personal blog is defined as a blog with any one of the following characteristics: only has one contributor, allows anonymous contributors without editorial oversight, doesn't have a masthead.

**2. Users may not post top-level comments on their own submissions.** Such comments will be automatically removed.

The review process for submissions is strict and detailed in NeutralPolitics. The mods view top-level comments by submitters as a way to circumvent that process, adding content that would not have been approved under the submission rules. Submitters are free to participate in the discussion as replies to other users.

**3. Submissions asking whether something is ""unusual"" (and other variations using that word) are no longer allowed.** They are considered non-specific and leading, and as such, violate submission rules A and B. 

 Submitters may still pose questions that examine historical standards and expectations in any of the following more evidence-based forms:

* Is there historical precedent for x?
* What are some examples of when x has happened before?
* In what ways, if any, does x break from historical norms?
* What legal/political/historical basis is there for X to be considered?

**3. Links that redirect from Google are now allowed**, so long as they don't disguise the final destination in the URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-california-pension-liabilities-20180118-story.html). Other redirecting links are still prohibited.

**4. After a [16-month hiatus,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xr3xn/meta_rneutralpolitics_is_opting_out_of_rall_and/) r/NeutralPolitics has returned to r/all on a trial basis.** As always, this runs the risk of attracting participants who don't follow the rules, so we remind our long-time users that the mods rely on reports to find comments that are in violation.

**5.

>3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

We believe this formulation better reflects the ethos of what we're asking of our users on NP.  The main change from the prior rule 3 is the specific prohibition on ""pejorative name calling.""  This prohibits using nicknames and slurs, except where the person using them intends to state that they're literally accurate.  In that case, a sourced explanation of why the name ascribed is accurate is permitted by the rules.

In addition, we added language that ""NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion based subreddit.""  This reflects the general ethos of what we're after here, and also allows for room to remove content which is nonserious but doesn't fit neatly into another rule, such as obvious trolling.

We are in the process of updating our automod rules to report (not remove) comments which contain keywords which are likely to violate this policy.  To that end, we need your help in composing a list of nicknames and substitute names which are very likely to be in violation of the rules.  We already have slurs and most regular insults in our automod filters - we're just looking for more public figure related ones now.

---

Partially in response to discount food [riots in 2018 over steep Nutella discounts](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42866417), France [passed legislation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/france-slap-legal-limits-food-discounts-wake-nutella-riots/) to stymy the cause of rioting at big box stores.

In January, France first put limits on how steep discounts can go:

> ...limit discounts to 34 per cent – half the Nutella price cuts...

In [March, they effectively killed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/02/16/big-brand-food-shopping-just-got-more-expensive-in-france/#79676a32a165) 'buy one get one free' promotions:

>  ...the amount of promotions which are allowed will be limited to just a quarter of the planned sales. So if a supermarket wants to sell 100 tubs of Nutella, from March, it can only run promotional offers on 25 of them.

---

In February, France effectively raised the cost of certain foods by 10%, but it's a little more complicated than that. According to French Minister of Agriculture and Food, Didier Guillaume, [the purpose is to spread more equity to farmers](https://www.20minutes.fr/economie/2439575-20190130-loi-alimentation-changements-panier-courses-vendredi) (Google translated from French, full interview [here](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/8h30-fauvelle-dely/loi-alimentation-il-faut-peut-etre-que-la-distribution-fasse-moins-de-profits-affirme-didier-guillaume_3146611.html)):

> ""What I'm asking big box stores is to find a way to spread the margins differently, to distribute things better, the objective is that agricultural products are sold at their fair value,"" argued the minister. The State hopes that, in return, the distribution will better pay producers from all sectors of agriculture and aquaculture, struggling because regularly paid below their cost.

Some more specific info on this measure (from source 4, 20Minutes, and through Google Translate):

> The recent Food Law raised the ""resale loss threshold"" or SRP to 10%. The government wants to force distributors to sell their calling products at prices 10% higher than those they have purchased. These products, which generate no profit but attract the barge, can no longer be sold at a loss. Specifically: a product bought 1 euro must be sold at least 1.10 euro.

> From 1 February, in supermarkets, ""500 products out of 13,000"" should increase, while in hypermarkets ""it is 800 products out of 20,000"" are concerned, according to the minister, who confirmed by relativizing information published in Le Parisien. Rather, they are consumer goods manufactured mostly by food giants (Danette, Coca-Cola, Caprice des Dieux, Ricard, Nutella, etc.) used by distributors in their promotional communication to attract the public. According to the Paris daily newspaper, the 750g Nutella pot would thus go from 4.05 to 4.39 euros, ie an 8.4% increase.

----

Cumulatively the effect of these laws strengthens the position of smaller suppliers (source 3, Forbes):

> The rationale is that supermarkets attract customers through promotional material of big brand products such as Coca-Cola, Danette, Ricard and Nutella, with whom smaller producers cannot compete. It’s an attempt to help farmers and smaller producers to become more competitive as they are now guaranteed a fair price.

----------------------------

It has been [well reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/trump-tariffs-foreign-autos.html) that the President of the United States has broad authority to impose tariffs on products that detract from U.S. national security.

> The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security.

Bolstering his position, President Trump has cited [a report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf) published by the U.S. Department of Commerce that asserts steel imports harm national security in the long run.

However the Commerce Department report addresses Canada directly:

> Our goal is to maximize domestic capabilities combined with supplies from unquestionably reliable third parties. The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]

This seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.

---------------------------------

These broad arguments for and against understanding Canada as a threat to U.S. steel production all come from the Commerce Department, and quite frankly they are a bit confusing.  Including additional domestic and foreign reports/sources, what are the arguments for and against Canada being a threat to U.S. steel production? 

---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada.

Many of you have recently noted a drop in the quality of discussion on NeutralPolitics. We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.

## Assume good faith

We are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.
As such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.


## Sweat the details

Each of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.


## Show your work

This community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.


## Engage with the argument, not the person

Things can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.


We will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit.

608,dmyfkl,False,None,145,What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry?,NeutralPolitics,"Recently, I've read this [post by John Stanton](https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/07/06/nationalize-the-defense-industry/) where he's arguing that the U.S. Defense Industry should be nationalised. In which, he discusses what he sees as issues with how the military and defence works, and how nationalising would help solve these problems. 

Some context:

Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans of a [Military Industrial Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex) - which is ""an alliance between military officers and corporations that supply the military that does not serve the public interest.""

Some groups have pushed in favour of further use of private military contractors. Well known Conservative thinktanks have called for [higher levels of privatization on military maintanence](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/privatizing-military-maintenance), while others, including Jared Kushner, have also called for [hirings of so-called ""private armies"", such as Blackwater](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-michaels-privatization-military-20170720-story.html) for deployment abroad. 



U.S. military spending has continued to [increase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/18/us-military-spending-set-increase-fifth-consecutive-year-nearing-levels-during-height-iraq-war/), meanwhile the top 100 companies around the world with military contracts, such as [Boeing and Raytheon,](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-9-biggest-defense-contractors-in-america-2016-5?r=US&IR=T#3-raytheon-company-3)  saw [$389 billion in total arms sales in 2018](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/). President Trump has been [warm to large military budgets](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/10/pentagon-eyes-windfall-as-trump-seeks-750-billion-defense-budget-military/), and has even nominated former Boeing board member, Patrick Shanahan, to [lead the Pentagon](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/05/10/trump-nominates-embodiment-military-industrial-complex-patrick-shanahan-lead).



However, critics of the current U.S. military system, like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, have openly [attacked the current system](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/08/02/we-cannot-keep-handing-over-billions-military-industrial-complex-says-sanders-senate), saying that current spending and management is causing a so-called [death spiral in the defense industry](http://nation.time.com/2011/07/19/the-defense-death-spiral/). Senator Warren has proposed plans to [ban military contractors from hiring former Pentagon officials](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/05/16/elizabeth-warren-announces-plan-to-unravel-military-industrial-complex/), and [proposes a bill that would curb Defense Lobbying](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-introduces-bill-to-curb-defense-lobbying/), which has had reports of [""wasteful contractor payments""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2018/10/05/republicans-and-contractor-lobbies-force-defense-into-wasteful-contractor-payments/)

610,bffokm,False,None,236,Can the President or a regular citizen be held liable for defaming a news organization?,NeutralPolitics,"For reference: [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation)

> Defamation, calumny, vilification, or traducement is the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of, depending on the law of the country, an individual, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation.

> Under common law, to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed. Some common law jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called slander, and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called libel.

Per accounts in the Mueller Report, President Trump lied and encouraged others to lie regarding reports from the media, and he used those lies as evidence of ""fake news"". 

From [AP](https://www.apnews.com/06c88719c3634e66a15adbbc658978b0)

>  [T]he Mueller’s report shows The New York Times and the Washington Post were correct when they reported in January 2018 that Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to make sure Mueller was fired, and that McGahn decided to resign rather than carry that out. When the Times first reported the story, Trump described it as “fake news, folks, fake news.”

> The Mueller report also showed that Trump directed a series of aides to ask McGahn to publicly deny the story, and ultimately asked himself, too. McGahn refused, saying the story was accurate, the report found.

Could specific instances of examples like the one above be used to show that the President has caused harm to the business via defamation?

For example, if the NYT could show a decline in subscribers or demographics and could correlate that to Trump's ""fake news""/lies could the President be held liable?

Follow up question, could a regular citizen be held liable for the same scenario?


Here is an additional reference regarding defamation.

[NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-law-made-simple-29718.html)

> The law of defamation varies from state to state, but there are some generally accepted rules. If you believe you are have been ""defamed,"" to prove it you usually have to show there's been a statement that is all of the following:

> * published
* false
* injurious
* unprivileged

Unprivileged wasn't clear to me. Here is the NOLO explanation. 

> [T]o qualify as a defamatory statement, the offending statement must be ""unprivileged."" Under some circumstances, you cannot sue someone for defamation even if they make a statement that can be proved false. For example, witnesses who testify falsely in court or at a deposition can't be sued. (Although witnesses who testify to something they know is false could theoretically be prosecuted for perjury.) Lawmakers have decided that in these and other situations, which are considered ""privileged,"" free speech is so important that the speakers should not be constrained by worries that they will be sued for defamation. Lawmakers themselves also enjoy this privilege: They aren't liable for statements made in the legislative chamber or in official materials, even if they say or write things that would otherwise be defamatory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bffokm/can_the_president_or_a_regular_citizen_be_held/,408,[removed] ,2019-04-20 18:54:16

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people.

Second, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/index) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

Mods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 70% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines.

616,f8u9cp,False,None,55,"Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's ""public charge"" rule?",NeutralPolitics,"First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.

&#x200B;

Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;  
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; 
* Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);  
* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps); 
* Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program; 
* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and 
* Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions). 

The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.    

Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.

So, my question is- Given that the vast majority of federal public benefits are off-limits to nonimmigrants, and the groups of people and types of assistance that are already not subject to the rule, who will actually be affected?

617,bomcl1,False,None,212,What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?,NeutralPolitics,"I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html)

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)).

Yang has stated the precise payout will eventually fluctuate by pegging the overall dollar amount to a particular resource, and he has made an express comparison to the Alaska Permanent Fund's annual individual payouts to certain Alaska state residents ([https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478)) (https://quillette.com/2019/03/06/in-defense-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend/).

Alaska's individual payouts are determined according to a set formula that averages the five year performance of the Alaska Permanent Fund (which is funded with a portion of state oil revenues) ([https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917](https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917)). Yang has indicated (in the clip above, a podcast that ran this Sunday; link is timestamped) that his UBI's individual payout amount would fluctuate with the profitability of artificial intelligence. 

Question: is it possible to treat an entire discrete industry as a resource for the sake of indexing the size and payout of a national social program to that industry's profitability? Do any other social programs in the U.S. fluctuate according to the success of a particular industry? Is the difference between oil (a commodity) and A.I. (not a commodity) relevant to the feasibility of this aspect of Yang's proposal?

Before being elected he proposed to [renegotiate or even cancel](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-energy-idUSKCN0YH2D9) the agreement. We can't know what his decision will be without speculating too much. However, we can ask what decision is politically optimal? 

This question has 2 parts. First one is how wide is a space of decisions, whether it's completely binary (accept/not accept agreement) or there is a set of points in between?

And second part is what decision represents common ground between positions of his supporters and opponents? Of course, if it's possible to find some compromise at all. 

Full text of Paris agreement is accessible from [here](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php). A summary is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en#tab-0-0) (unfortunately, I haven't found one that is both clear and concise). 

EDIT: here are some graphs on public opinion: about [global warming](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/ps_2016-10-04_politics-of-climate_0-02/) and [paris agreement](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Politics-and-Global-Warming-November-2016-01.png)(86% of dems and 51% of reps support it).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs

So among the set of people who oppose the Paris climate agreement are large portions of Trump voters (especially in coal country who would be hit hard by any restrictions on pollution and whom he has vocally defended), the oil and gas industries whom he has also vocally defended and who are contributing millions (hundreds of billions, in the case of the Saudis) to his continued efforts, and Russia (whose own fossil fuel interests hang in the balance if Europe, its main customer, pursues alternative industries).  With all those keys pushing for a definite opposition to the Paris agreement, and with only the cold comfort of marginally appeasing the leaders of the EU (for whom Trump shows obvious disdain) and the liberal wing of the country (who show their obvious disdain for Trump already in the ""fake news"" liberal media), it's a really easy decision for Trump to make if he doesn't care at all about what people who already don't like him think about him.

625,62m9sv,False,None,195,United States Healthcare as a Superior Good,NeutralPolitics,"I recently was linked to [the following article](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/09/25/high-us-health-care-spending-is-quite-well-explained-by-its-high-material-standard-of-living/) which, although about a year old, makes the argument that the United States is actually not an outlier in Healthcare Expenditure per capita (HCE). The article seems pretty well backed up by data; the argument as best I understand it can be summarized as follows:

1. Healthcare is a superior good, namely a good where as wealth increases the proportion of that wealth spent on that good also increases. To whit; if wealth increases 10%, HCE tends to increase around 12 or 13%.
2. Many analyses of HCE involve comparisons to GDP, but this is misleading because GDP involves exports and government spending, which are not direct reflections of a populations' material wealth.
3. There are other, better measures of a populations' wealth and standards of living including Actual Individual Consumption (AIC).
4. When you plot HCE vs GDP and include more countries, especially those with more diverse economies, there are more outliers than just the United States. Plotting HCE vs AIC handles these countries much better.
5. If you look at HCE vs AIC plots over time, all countries gradually trend to spending more of their wealth in healthcare because (as in point 1) healthcare is a superior good.

The conclusion is essentially that, when you look at how materially wealthy the United States actually is, our spending is not an outlier. We spend a lot more because healthcare is a superior good and the the United States is a lot more wealthy and consumes a much greater volume of healthcare than other countries.

In addition, since healthcare is a labor-intensive good, it does not benefit from some of the same efficiencies of technology that other industries (such as manufacturing) might.

My first thought upon reading this article was to point out that even if it was true that our spending is roughly in line with what a sufficiently wealthy nation might expect, aren't our outcomes [much worse](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/oct/us-spends-more-on-health-care-than-other-nations)?

The same author has [another post](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/us-life-expectancy-is-below-naive-expectations-mostly-because-it-economically-outperforms/) that I haven't read as thoroughly, but I believe he argues that our poor outcomes can be explained largely in part through [poor lifestyle choices](http://www.mtda.com/bu/tr00077E.pdf) and, paradoxically, the adverse effects material wealth can have on a populations' health. He makes the salient point that if our institutions were largely to blame for poor outcomes we might expect to see poor healthcare outcomes throughout the country (since our institutions don't differ all that much), but we don't see anything of the kind; our outcomes are highly regional; ultimately he centers the blame on smoking, obesity, low activity, and accident rates. I will note that he has some discussion of race that may make some readers uncomfortable; I am not familiar enough with the topic to know if he is making correct claims or if that part of the analysis is discriminatory and bogus.

All of the above seems at least plausible to me. 

But is it correct? How might this be reconciled with stories about how [hospital prices are in some sense made up](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) and the actual price per procedure in the United States is often [hilariously different from other countries](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/072116/us-healthcare-costs-compared-other-countries.asp)? I haven't heard this sort of argument before and it is so at odds with conventional wisdom that I am very interested in discussion of whether or not it's actually accurate.

The videos are used to indicate that the people recorded have organized and paid others to violently disrupt Donald Trump rallies, and to engage in voter fraud.

As [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) indicates, impeachment is purely a political process and not a legal one. Therefore, the rules and procedures of a traditional trial that most people are most familiar with do not exactly apply in an impeachment trial.

In fact, according to the *[Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials]( https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf)*, in an impeachment trial, the “Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue… all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.” In other words, as the majority party of the Senate, the GOP appears to have the power to set the rules.

Furthermore, the rules also state (bold emphasis by me):

> And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy  of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, **unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate**; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

And thus it seems that the Chief Justice can be overridden in their rulings if a majority of the Senate votes on it.

(p. 26) The basic problem, he says, is that individual voters' votes have so little chance of making a difference that most are not incentivized to be informed, unless they happen to find political knowledge interesting, feel they have a moral duty to be informed, or some other extenuating factor.

Democracy, Brennan argues, systematically violates the *competence principle*, ""which holds that high-stakes political decisions are presumed to be unjust, illegitimate, and lacking in authority if they are made incompetently or in bad faith, or by a generally incompetent decision-making body."" (p. 21) He likens much democratic decision-making to a doctor who writes you a prescription after consulting an Ouija board, and universal suffrage to indiscriminantly giving everyone a plumber's (or medical) license.

Brennan's proposed solution (or potential solution) is *epistocracy*, a system in which ""political power is to some degree apportioned according to knowledge."" An epistocracy makes some attempt to give more-informed citizens more political power (or give poorly-informed citizens less political power) in order to better abide by the competence principle. In the book he gives several examples of how this might work:

* **Restricted suffrage and plural voting**: Use some kind of voter qualification exam to identify which voters are more competent, and either disqualify the votes of poorly-informed voters or grant extra votes to well-informed voters.
* **Enfranchisement lottery**: Select a random, representative subset of citizens who will be able to earn the right to vote in the coming election by participating in a competence-building process.
* **Universal suffrage with epistocratic veto**: Similar to present democracies, except a formally epistocratic ruling body, open to all citizens able to meet competency or character-based requirements, is able to veto the decisions of the electorate, while these vetoes could be overridden by a supermajority vote. Brennan points out that we already have a body similar to this in the Supreme Court, which is a present-day example of an epistocratic council with veto power over decisions made by the electorate (or those they elect).
* **Government by simulated oracle**: By administering surveys that gauge peoples' political preferences, demographic characteristics, and basic objective political knowledge, we could simulate what would happen if they electorate's demographics remained unchanged, but everyone were well-informed, and then act according to this simulated electorate's will.

Brennan spends much of the book not arguing for epistocracy so much as for evaluating epistocracy on instrumental rather than procedural grounds. Democracy is to be preferred only it it produces a more just outcome, not because it is an intrinsically or uniquely just political process; he spends a few chapters addressing arguments to the contrary. He acknowledges that epistocracy in the real world is untested and will not be perfect, and will likely share many of democracy's flaws as well as some new ones, but argues that ""the interesting question is whether epistocracy, warts and all, would perform better than democracy, warts and all."" He thinks we have good reason to believe that it would.

The two most powerful arguments Brennan sees against epistocracy are 1) that it would likely award more political power to already-advantaged groups and/or take it away from disadvantaged ones (the demographic objection), and 2) that radically remaking social structures is dangerous given human imperfection (the conservative objection). In response to which Brennan points out 1) that the inequality causing some demographic groups to be disadvantaged and poorly-informed is a symptom of deeper issues that developed under democracy (and which epistocracy could potentially do a better job of addressing), and 2) that Edmund Burke initially raised the conservative objection in the 1790s regarding the French Revolution and in favor of monarchy, only to be subsequently proven wrong in the case of democracy.

Given the problem of voter ignorance Brennan highlights, could epistocracy produce better outcomes, and if so, should it be adopted, perhaps on some smaller scale initially? Or are there still compelling reasons to continue favoring democracy, ""warts and all""?

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-fed/fed-aims-bazooka-to-backstop-coronavirus-hit-economy-idUSKBN21A1U2

Under the new programs, the Fed will lend against student loans, credit card loans, and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, and buy bonds of larger employers and make loans to them in what amounts to four years of bridge financing.

I would like a better understanding of the short (1 month), medium (6-12 month), and long term (1 year and beyond) goals and expected impacts. Has the Fed enacted similar programs in the past? If so, what were their short, medium and long term impacts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/fnqnp5/what_are_the_short_medium_long_term_stated_goals/,394,"According to several sources, including [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/ef3539ec-5f96-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4), the top 5% of US wealth holders pay 60% of tax receipts annually. I think it's well understood that a large portion of the taxable income for these individuals is through capital gains, so we can extend that further to safely assume that a depreciation in equity and bond prices will directly lead to an increased federal deficit. 

If you can accept that, this directly stands against the old adage that the stock market is not the real economy, but only a reflection of it. In fact, the stock market (and to a larger extent, the bond market) *is the US economy*, as sad as that is. 

More anecdotally, you can see this to be the case as unemployment claims rise coincidentally when the stock market tanks and vise versa. I submit that these aren't two separate events occurring that stem from the same macroeconomic environment, but rather there is a cause and effect relationship. If you think about it logically, a business whose stock price tanks is unable to sell corporate bonds at reasonable interest rates to raise cash even though the two are not mechanically linked. 

The Fed knows this, and this is why they run to the rescue every time there is a hiccup in markets even though it's not technically one of their dual mandates to protect stock prices. They cannot hope to save the economy without also (first) saving the stock market. This puts them in an inherently awkward position of looking like they're running to the aid of the 5% while the 95% are suffering orders of magnitude more. I don't say this to defend the Fed because it's a crisis of their own making, but it is the situation nonetheless.

So they've done the helicopter money for corporations in the past after 2008 and people obviously didn't like it. They can't risk doing the same thing again because there would undoubtedly be extreme civil unrest at a second corporate bailout without a simultaneous bailout for individuals who (rightfully) felt like they got the short end of the stick the last time around.

So that's my read on *why* a Main Street bailout is on the table this time around. I don't believe, for a second, that it has anything to do with coronavirus or it's effects.

Anyway, the implied argument from the Fed here is that despite the money printing after the financial crisis, there was no real inflation in the real economy so they can do it again on a wider scale. The problem is that the two types of bailouts are likely to have very different effects, but the Fed either chooses to ignore that fact or they're blissfully unaware (which seems unlikely).

The last bailout *did* lead to inflation--it's just that the inflation was limited to asset prices. See the increase in wealth equality, where the asset owners in the country made out like bandits while we got priced out of equities, real estate, rents, and everything else that is considered an asset. It *did not* lead to inflation in consumer goods, which is what we typically think about when we talk about inflation. The reason is fairly simple, in my opinion. The bailout money went into the pockets of those that were only ever going to use it to buy more assets. JP Morgan and staff weren't waiting for the bailout money so they could go buy a new refrigerator or hire a plumber, so you didn't see inflation there.

What the Fed is attempting to do now, alongside the corporate bailouts, is to inject money directly into the consumer market. This *has the potential* to lead to consumer goods inflation because this money is going to people who *will* use it on a new TV.

However, this isn't just bad news because bread will cost more. *If inflation sets in*, it can unravel the entire US financial system and take pensions and retirement savings with it. This is because in an inflationary environment, bond prices have to drop, particularly longer term bonds. You wouldn't buy a 30 year bond that pays 3% if inflation is projected to be 5% because you're effectively gauranteeing yourself a 2% loss over that time. This is the exact opposite effect of what the Fed is hoping to do, which is to keep rates low (and bond prices high). 

If bond prices drop at the same time as stock prices, pretty much the entire risk parity investment portfolio that is the bedrock of American finance goes into tailspin. Pension commitments won't be sustainable. Retirement accounts will start to lose value on both stocks and bonds without a good alternative right as the largest demographic of people (boomers) hits retirement age. This will increase the burden on social safety net programs at the same time that tax revenues have fallen (which is where I began my comment). So less money in, more money out. This will exacerbate drop in bond prices as market participants become increasingly worried about the US either A) not being able to meet it's commitments to bond holders, or B) trying to print their way out of those commitments. It's a positive feedback loop.

This is all doom and gloom but it has happened to almost every capitalist economy sooner or later, so there's no reason to think the United States is different in that respect. The only question is *when*. What the virus might have done is to speed up that clock by putting stress on the system prematurely. 

The number to watch to figure it what will happen in the medium end long term is inflation. If the Fed is somehow able to do everything they're saying they will do without inflation, it will be the first Central Bank that has it ""all figured out"". If inflation rears its head, the Fed literally has no tools to stop it with the current economic situation. ",2020-03-23 19:53:47

[This Census visualization from '76 to '12](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9) shows a sudden drop in median household income among minorities around 2000.

[Figure 2 on this page](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm#Figure 2) shows that the decline of blacks and Hispanics in poverty suddenly stopped and poverty of those groups began increasing again around the same time. Figure 3 on the same page shows the poverty rates among children in those groups, which is even more prominent.

Despite the amount of data, there's not a lot to go on for why the sudden shift. Typically when you see spikes/dives in large datasets like these, there's one or a small handful of factors that can be identified as causual.

In the United States it looks like you have two options: either have the DA drop the case and then ICE takes juristiction of the unrelated immigration matter, or the person serves their sentence and then gets deported at the end of it.

So I was confused because I was wondering why on Earth a country would want to deport someone who is so obviously at risk to the population *rather than* imprison them. That would screw over another country's population and/or allow the criminal to go free.  But it appears here that England might instead do as the US does: have him serve his sentence, then deport afterwards.

On the whole though, I think revoking citizenship is a horribly misguided and xenophobic action. A country should be made to deal with its own citizens, not pawn them off to other countries.

This sparked a few questions in my head.

1. Can we constitutionally introduce federal laws capping how much more CEO's can make than their employees? For example, a law that says CEO's can only make 10x or 50x more than the lowest earning employee? 

2. If we can, what are the possible drawbacks and benefits of this?

In response to this, I have to say that while 10 to 50 bucks isn't a lot to a lot of us, it can make a big difference to a family that is living paycheck to paycheck. 50 bucks a paycheck is 100 bucks a month. That covers a bill or two. That could mean the difference between choosing to fill the tank or fill your belly. It could mean someone can finally start putting a few bucks a month away for an emergency or for retirement (lol what's that?)

A common piece of advice is for people to put money away for retirement early. Even if it's just 10 bucks a month. Another piece of advice, which fits in nicely here is [wait until your next pay increase is added to your paycheck and divert that amount into your defined contribution plan.](https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/savings/save-for-retirement-even-while-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-14561929).

Specifically, he lied about conversations he had with Kislyak, regarding Sanctions and about Israeli settlements:

and

> Flynn also engaged in a similar back-and-forth with the Russian ambassador over a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The incoming Trump administration opposed the resolution, and Flynn asked the Russian envoy to either oppose the measure or delay it. Flynn was directed by a ""very senior member"" of the transition team to make the request, court papers say.

Flynn ultimately pled guilty to the charges and made a statement afterwards, saying:

From the [""Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018""](https://rhg.com/research/final-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease.

Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.

Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that [""...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that [""...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government.

According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up.

Is the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?

How does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?

659,fyzk0n,False,None,220,"Up to today, what characteristics do countries with effective COVID-19 containment strategies have versus those that have struggled?",NeutralPolitics,"This is obviously difficult to nail down completely empirically, as some countries like South Korea [did mass testing of the population](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-south-korea-italy-mass-testing-covid19-will-keep-spreading/), finding many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Many places may have had [people who had the disease](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/have-i-already-had-coronavirus-how-would-i-know) earlier but were never identified as positive. Also many countries have perhaps engaged in practices to avoid the stigma of high death counts. Previous cases of death from influenza and pneumonia are now [perhaps undiagnosed COVID-19](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/04/cdc-launches-studies-to-get-more-precise-count-of-undetected-covid-19-cases/) cases.
And obviously, inequality plays a role in the numbers. Countries with low testing capacity will have low numbers of formally identified cases, but that does not mean low levels of COVID-19 cases and coronavirus characters.

But, to this point (rather than speculating about the future), what empirically has worked in reducing cases and deaths? New Zealand has [five million people and about a thousand cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinspencer1/2020/04/10/new-zealands-pm-is-leading-a-masterclass-on-coronavirus-response/#5883ea865793), but deaths are in the single digits. Taiwan's response to coronavirus has been so competent that there are now [calls for it to join the WHO](https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-coronavirus-success-bolsters-case-150420811.html), which like many international bodies it is not a member due to the ongoing One China dispute with Mainland China.  

The U.S, Italy, France, and Spain have all had huge issues keeping cases below the capacity of the healthcare system. According to [one projection of the US](https://covidactnow.org/), many states and counties are at risk of overwhelming hospitals within the next month or two, unless social distancing and stay at home measures are more rigorously enforced. Italy faced issues with an aging population and an abnormally high death rate.

A final factor is the issue of second waves and the return of the infection given that international travel will eventually begin to open again. Singapore, which isolated and avoided community transmission, [now has new clusters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/09/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong-singapore-taiwan.html) due to travelers who were not identified as having the virus. That article also gives another opinion on Taiwan's efforts, showing the importance of looking at containment as something that takes months, rather than a few weeks. COVID-19 can take a while to kill after initial infection, with recovery taking weeks if not months. Here is an [excerpt from an NPR story on it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn):

> The most severe cases — about 6% of patients — end up in intensive care with multi-organ failure, respiratory failure and septic shock, according to a February report from the WHO. And many hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen. In extreme cases, they need mechanical ventilation — including the use of a sophisticated technology known as ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which basically acts as the patient's lungs, adding oxygen to their blood and removing carbon dioxide. The technology ""allows us to save more severe patients,"" Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said at a press conference In February.
> 
> Many of the more serious cases have been in people who are middle-aged and elderly — Furuya notes that our immune system gets weaker as we age. She says for long-term smokers, it could be even worse because their airways and lungs are more vulnerable. People with other underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or chronic lung disease, have also proved most vulnerable. Furuya says those kinds of conditions can make it harder for the body to recover from infections.
> 
> ""Of course, you have outliers — people who are young and otherwise previously healthy who are dying,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR's 1A show. ""But if you look at the vast majority of the people who have serious disease and who will ultimately die, they are in that group that are either elderly and/or have underlying conditions.""
> 
> Estimates for the case fatality rate for COVID-19 vary depending on the country. But data from both China and Lombardy, Italy, show the fatality rate starts rising for people in their 60s. In Lombardy, for instance, the case fatality rate for those in their 60s is nearly 3 percent. It's nearly 10 percent for people in their 70s and more than 16 percent for those in their 80s.

661,8jonuh,False,None,41,"[META] Announcing new, more detailed rules guidance.",NeutralPolitics,"After having some issues recently relating to clarity of the rules, we have decided to make a substantial revamp of our rules wiki and adopt detailed explanations for each rule, giving examples and additional information for almost every aspect of them.

None of these explanations are changes to the rules, but they should hopefully codify how we have come to interpret and enforce them over time, and make it easier for users to understand where we're coming from.

---

#Submission rules

A) **Ask a specific political question.** We do not allow overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, surveys, [requests to explain public opinion or media coverage,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/209fox/meta_the_np_community_cannot_explain_public/) posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.
 
 * NeutralPolitics is principally focused on questions of policy and governance.  Analyzing things like media coverage, public opinion and the like are outside of our wheelhouse.
 * A solicitation of pure opinion is a question which can't be answered with facts people could source.

 * For example ""should healthcare be a legal right?"" is a pure opinion question, whereas ""what have been successful and unsuccessful attempts to legally establish positive rights?"" is a question people can answer with facts about what has been done in the past.

 * Questions about ""why"" people do things often run afoul of rule A.  It's very hard to answer a question about motivations with facts, since it's asking our users to read minds.  It's better to ask things like what the stated reasons for a political action are, or who stands to benefit or be harmed by the action.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.** The post must not be inflammatory, editorialized, leading towards a particular answer, a statement of opinion, or a request to critique your theory.

 * This rule can be tricky to follow, but we've written up some detailed tips [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/)

 * Try to give all sides of a question.  If it's an ongoing issue of debate, link to articles which give multiple perspectives on the question.

 * Do not state things which are highly debated as unequivocally true.  Say (and link) who is asserting their truth and let the source do the arguing in their own name.

 * **Do not answer your own question!** A post which tries to answer the headline question is inherently going to break rule B.

 * Avoid negative framing.* 

  * Instead of asking ""Why don't we do [X policy]?""  ask, What are the pros and cons of [X policy]?""

  * Instead of ""Why doesn't [X politician] do Y?"" ask ""What are the precedents for [an office-holder/candidate] doing Y?""

C) **Outline the issue well.** Give more than just a headline. Provide some background information.

 * This rule is fairly straightforward, but basically it means you should provide enough information so that people understand the context for the question.  News articles or research articles on the subject matter should also be included so there is more background people can read before answering.

D) **Provide sources.** Statements of fact must cite [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Nothing is ""common knowledge."" **Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected.** (Sole exception: if you cannot find specific information after a thorough online search, you may post a request for sources.)

* This rule ensures that submissions are based on factual claims with some outside basis, not just the impressions of the asker.

* If you ""heard"" something, source it.

 * If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it. If you want, you can even modmail us and ask for help with your post. Most of us are news or policy junkies and probably can help you find some good sources.

* Don't attribute a statement to an general group. Name a person who said the thing.

 * Another big issue we get is things like ""people on the right/the left/republicans/democrats/the media"" have been saying X. Often X is an inflammatory/strawman argument.

 * Like things you ""heard about,"" this will not do. NeutralPolitics doesn't do blind quotes. Find an opinion article or something with a named person making that argument. For example:

  * **Bad** ""[X party] has been saying that [Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.

  * **Good** [Person A], a [X party] member of Congress, said ""[Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls."" [link to source]

* We are much stricter with sources for submissions than for comments.  Please see the [source guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) for more information.

* Requests for sources are rarely allowed, and only when a subject is not easily searched on the internet after substantial effort.  We are not ELI5 or another subreddit for casual questions.  If you are considering such a submission, we strongly suggest [sending us a modmail first.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics&subject=Request%20for%20Sources%20Post&message=)

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.** The purpose of this forum is to discuss issues. We do not allow polls, surveys or requests for fact checking.

* This is a close corollary of rule A.  But the gist of it is that we are looking for questions which our users can answer with Reddit comments.

* We are especially strict about this rule when it comes to promoting anything of your own.  We will categorically reject any submission which includes a link to any article or video or other thing which you are the author or creator of.

F) **Title the post accurately.** The title must match the contents.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question cannot be answered with facts — which includes any that are phrased in the future tense (What will/would/could happen?) — then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

* NeutralPolitics is a fact based forum, and questions which ask to predict the future necessarily ask for things which can't be answered with facts.

* Try rephrasing the question to ask what has happened in similar past cases.

* We also prohibit in this category questions whose answer cannot be provided by any user. (e.g. what are the nuclear launch codes; what are the contents of a sealed court case).

* As mentioned with rule A, ""Why"" questions often violate rule G.  They ask our users to speculate about the contents of a person's mind, as opposed to something answerable with facts.

#Comment Rules

1) **Be courteous.** Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

* Our commitment to civil discourse is one of the core principles of NeutralPolitics, and we do not make any exceptions from this rule.

* Any language which a reasonable observer would conclude disparages another user in any way is considered a violation of this rule.  Even if you did not intend that.

* **""But it was true"" is not a defense.**  Accusing another user of something is prohibited, even if you believe that accusation to be true.

* **""They started it"" is not a defense.**  If another user breaks the rules, please report the comment.  Replying with a rule violating comment of your own will just get both of them removed and makes that much more work for the mod team.

2) **Source your facts.** If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

* This rule is the core of our commitment to fact-based discourse.

* We do not allow claims of expertise or anecdotal evidence to substitute for providing sources.

* We do not allow image sources because they are too easy to manipulate and there's no good way to verify they come from where they purport to.

* We do not allow video sources unless accompanied by text sources because they are too hard for us to moderate and it is unreasonable to ask people to watch a video to check what you're claiming is true.

* Phrasing a statement of fact in the form of a question (""Isn't it true that [X]?"") will be treated as a statement that [X] is true, and needs a source.

* Stating it is your opinion that something is true does not absolve the necessity of sourcing that claim.

* For more detail, read our section on [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources)

3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion-based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

* A NeutralPolitics comment should not just be a general a reaction to the subject matter of the post, but should try to advance a substantive point of some sort backed up by evidence.

* Joke and meme comments are prohibited as not further advancing a productive conversation.

* One-liner comments are prohibited because we want to foster detailed and substantive discussion, and it harms that when people don't put effort into what they're saying.

* Off topic replies are prohibited.  We curate the types of questions we allow under rule A for a reason.

* [Pejorative name calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7mn3a5/meta_announcing_a_revised_rule_3_and_a_request/) means any use of a demeaning name to describe a person or group when it's not accompanied by a sourced explanation of why the name is literally accurate.


4) **Address the arguments, not the person.** The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.

* As a part of our commitment to a fact-based discussion, we find that comments which try to go to people's personal motivations or personal conduct are detrimental to our subreddit.

* The subject of discussion on NP is never the conduct or motives of another user, but is always about the substance of what people are saying.  Comments which get personal, even if not directly accusatory or rude, are something which take conversations off topic, and so are banned here.

* The purpose of a discussion is also not to prove another user wrong about something, but rather to inform all readers by using evidence to demonstrate the facts about something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8jonuh/meta_announcing_new_more_detailed_rules_guidance/,379,"Question - why do you allow two month old accounts to mod your sub with full permission?

663,5hxwfr,False,None,295,What are the pros and cons of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's approach to education reform?,NeutralPolitics,"I’ve been hearing a lot about Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, some of it bad and some of it good. [It seems pretty clear that]( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos) she strongly supports “school choice” – in other words, she is a supporter of scholarship tax credits, vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools.
I’ve seen hefty criticism of her approach to public education, and I’ve also seen some praise, as well as some sources that [give a pretty even rundown of both sides of the debate]( http://www.balancedpolitics.org/school_vouchers.htm). [According to what I’ve been able to find] ( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos), the pros of her approach are:

- It will encourage more innovation in schools, helping to move our stagnated public education system forward by creating competition.

- It will give poor families the same opportunity to choose their kids’ education as rich families have.

- Those who attend private schools generally have [higher SAT scores]( http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) than those who attend public schools. However, [others]( http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/comparing-private-public-school-test-scores/) say that once you apply a standardized test such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and adjust it for socioeconomic factors, there is little to no difference between the scores of public and private schools.

- Private schools allow students to attain a greater depth in subjects that interest them.

- Private schools are more effective than public schools at managing their money.

The cons, on the other hand, are:

- Vouchers drain funds from public schools.

- Private schools aren’t monitored as closely as public schools; therefore, there is a risk that some may not provide a fair, balanced, or responsible education.

- Whereas public schools are open to everyone, private schools can discriminate based on a variety of factors. However, I would personally argue that public schools also discriminate in a way, based on income – because public school funding is tied to property values, [lower-income families tend to be stuck with lower-quality schools]( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem).

- Some, such as the [NY Times]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html), cite her track record as an example of what will happen if she implements her policies as Secretary of Education. However, the Times also acknowledges that this doesn’t automatically discount the potential of charter schools, citing their success in New Orleans, where rigorous oversight from local leaders ensures that the schools don’t discriminate.

So I’m curious to know your guys’ take on this. What are the pros and cons of her approach to education, and do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the country?

On one hand, some people aren't able to live off of minimum wage when working full time: https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/06 (This of course is dependent on location. Switch to, say, Wyoming and it might look different.) In addition, an increased minimum wage would supposedly require very little increase in prices and/or decrease in profit taking (a 10% increase in minimum wage is correlated with a 0.3% increase in CPI, see page 3): https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2017/the-local-aggregate-effects-of-minimum-wage-increases.aspx#:~:text=Abstract,outcomes%20besides%20employment%20and%20wages.&text=minimum-wage%20workers.-,Increases%20in%20minimum%20wages%20also%20lower%20debt%20among%20households%20with,to%20increase%20access%20to%20credit.

667,8ey5nu,False,None,285,"Should prostitution be legal, illegal, or decriminalized in the west?",NeutralPolitics,"[As it stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region), most of the west handles prostitution with some degree of prohibition or criminalization, whether it be on purchasers, sex workers, related acts (running a brothel, pimping, etc.), or all three. While some nations like the Netherlands and Germany have fully legalized the industry, restriction is still the status quo.

Associated with this issue are a wide array of problems and questions, such as human trafficking, the role of the state, the morality of the act of prostitution itself, the freedom and health of women involved, and so on. Many support full legalization, for reasons that typically include minimizing harm, promoting health and safety, and eliminating non-violent/victimless crimes ([example](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-raphael/legalize-prostitution_1_b_4251956.html)). Others support continued criminalization or restriction on the basis of traditional moral rejection of prostitution. Other still support continued criminalization for buyers because they view the industry and inherently predatory and abusive, and fear legalization would expand it and increase instances of things like sex trafficking ([example](https://nordicmodelnow.org)).

How should prostitution be handled in the west?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8ey5nu/should_prostitution_be_legal_illegal_or/,374,"I used to be neutral on this issue but now have refined it to being conditionally neutral.  

First and foremost, [the demand is there...it's always been there.   It's also very strong.](http://www.newsweek.com/growing-demand-prostitution-68493)  What this means is that, like the opioid epidemic, or Prohibition before it, criminalizing it will simply drive that demand underground.

Given that the demand is there, what are the consequences of legalizing prostitution?  In Korea, prostitution is nominally illegal, yet [its government has admitted it comprised a significant portion of its GDP,](http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647) the idea being that, regardless of legality, it can be used as a benchmark to determine societal consequences of prostitution.  It bears noting that, as has been true historically, prostitutes in SK are overwhelmingly women, and that [""Women made up 86 percent of all violent crime victims in 2013"", and that ""the World Economic Forum ranks the country 115th out of 145 countries in gender equality. Women earn only two-thirds of what men earn, according to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. Women made up 2.3 percent of corporate executives at 348 of the largest 500 companies in South Korea in 2015 \(others were exempt from reporting\)""](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/opinion/south-koreas-misogyny.html), and that[ the employment rate of women around 30 years of age drops off significantly](https://thediplomat.com/2016/08/the-struggles-of-south-koreas-working-women/), which ""represents socially pervasive stereotypes and structural barriers to women’s competitiveness in the Korean workforce.""

This is anecdotal, but I can corroborate the utter pervasiveness of the sex trade in that country, and that it's ubiquitous in business meetings, especially during negotiations.  Businesswomen are almost non-existent in these kind of environments...how can it be otherwise, when agreements and deals are made while the dealmakers are getting blowjobs from female prostitutes?

This is what made me realize that prostitution, despite the demand and etc, has social consequences in societies where gender equality is neither prevalent nor seen as a priority, and in such societies, legalizing prostitution would likely exacerbate embedded inequalities.

669,6jpq9b,False,None,251,Does the Minimum Wage Hurt Low-Income Workers?,NeutralPolitics,"A [study](https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/NBER%20Working%20Paper.pdf) released 6/26/17 from the University of Washington revealed the following about the results of the Seattle minimum wage increase:

> Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in
all sectors paying below a specified real hourly rate, we conclude that the second wage increase
to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such
jobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees’ earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016

A $1500 annual reduction (or 6.6%) in pay for someone making ~~minimum wage~~ less than $19/hour seems like a big hit. Did this policy end up hurting a demographic of society that it was intended to help?

Here are additional commentaries on the study.

[538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-gone-too-far/) commented on the advantage of the level of detail the data they used had:

>The Washington study has one big advantage over most past research: The authors had access to detailed data on the hours and earnings of nearly all employees in Washington state, allowing them to measure the effects of the minimum wage much more directly than is possible with less complete datasets.

[Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/uw-study-finds-seattles-minimum-wage-is-costing-jobs/) mentioned a quote from one of the researchers who conducted the study:

>“If you’re a low-skilled worker with one of those jobs, $125 a month is a sizable amount of money,” said Mark Long, a UW public-policy professor and one of the authors of the report. “It can be the difference between being able to pay your rent and not being able to pay your rent.”

The US and much of the rest of the world have historically cooperated via a [series of international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) to outlaw many recreational drugs, including cannabis, LSD, cocaine and so on. Recent trends in cannabis in the United States and [other nations](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/global-marijuana-cannabis-laws/) have thrown this old equilibrium into question. On top of this, some nations like Portugal have [experimented with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/?utm_term=.1d839e2c929c) decriminalizing all recreational drugs, including ""hard drugs"". 

The connection between narcotic prohibition and crime has long been noted, especially with regards to [terrorists in Afghanistan](http://www.opium.org/how-does-opium-fund-terrorism.html) and [cartels in Mexico](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-cartel-guide-2015-12).

Is decriminalization and legalization of such recreational drugs sound policy? What positive effects does it have, and what are its drawbacks?

673,5pe4tk,False,None,339,How prevalent are secular/Atheist Conservatives? What are the reasons underlying their political persuasion?,NeutralPolitics,"Speaking personally, I am a non-religious Democrat, and I would say that my lack of religiosity at least somewhat influences my views on social issues. I did, however, grow up in a religious household and was a Republican by age eighteen. I've changed a lot since then, but at that time, my views on social issues were very much influenced by my religious beliefs.

So that leads me to wonder, what are the motivating factors in an Atheist or secular individual gravitating towards a Conservative/Republican worldview?

If right-leaning stances on social issues are not in any way influenced by religion, then what would be the reasoning behind, say, being against same-sex marriage or being pro-life? (I know these are the obvious hot-button issues, I'm just using them as easy examples)

Maybe their secular Conservatism generally has more of a basis in a single issue such as Economics or Gun rights?

Surely there must be some folks who self-identify this way and can offer some insight? I would just like to understand more about this as it fascinates me.

EDIT:  [Here is an article from Gallup including a statistic indicating that Conservatives generally skew towards a religious disposition.](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/182210/highly-religious-conservative-republicans.aspx)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5pe4tk/how_prevalent_are_secularatheist_conservatives/,372,"Anecdotal but I am conservative with agnostic leanings. My problem with gay marriage isn't the fact that it's two same sex couples but it's the fact that the state is getting involved in religious affairs which should be separate and as such government intervention may lead to religious figures being forced to conduct religious ceremonies for gay people at the threat of the law. Otherwise, I have no problem with a consensual gay marriage, and would encourage it if concensus is given for all parties involved.

I am a mix of pro-life and pro-choice. It's hard to define when a person becomes a person, so I give some leniency but I draw the line at 18 weeks when the child has potential to live outside the womb and has developed sensory nerves and a functional heartbeat. This is a line upheld in a many European countries. 

I am pro-gun. I believe everyone has the reasonable right to defend themselves from others and a tyrannical government.

I also like a balanced budget. I often find liberal ideas good on the surface, but an absolute disaster once you look into the details of it.

674,4cxs5o,False,None,125,[META] New ban policy,NeutralPolitics,"**This is not an April Fools joke!**

It's a point of pride for the mod team here that we've banned very few users over the history of this subreddit. Given the topics we deal with, and the volatile environment created by online anonymity, you might expect that we issue frequent bans, but we've found that we can usually avoid them by directly engaging the users. We've had users who started off combative or flaunting the rules, but after numerous discussions and warnings from the mods, turned into valuable contributors.

We would like to continue that approach, but the fact is, it's not sustainable. 

First, it takes too much time. Frequent exchanges with a single user, who may post 5-10 comments a day that draw reports, are a drain on the whole mod team and they take us away from other important business. It's far easier to simply ban that user and end up with 5-10 fewer reports a day to investigate. We have always resisted that easy route, but with our current levels of traffic that has to change.

Second, as the election has gotten steam, electoral politics has become dominant over policy in many NeutralPolitics discussions. We've had a number of problematic interactions with users whose primary purpose for being on NP is to promote or denigrate particular candidates, and the heightened passions are showing the inadequacies of our prior policy on bans.

As has always been the case, multiple violations of the rules will draw a ban warning. However, from today forward, **users who respond inappropriately to the ban warning, either by failing to adjust the offending behavior or by being combative with the mods, will be banned immediately.** At the moderators' discretion, that ban may or may not be permanent.

For clarity, our internal policy around banning a user is as follows: A ban is proposed to the full mod team by a specific mod with the reasoning stated. The team then votes on the proposal. The motion carries if a simple majority of all mods who participate are in favor, and that majority must include one of the two most senior mods.

676,7do6tv,False,None,143,GOP Tax Bill and Tuition Waivers,NeutralPolitics,"One thing that's been cropping up in the news quite a bit recently is the impact that the new GOP Tax Bill ([the one passed by the House](https://waysandmeansforms.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bill_text.pdf)) would have on tuition waivers. I've seen quite a bit of reporting (see [here](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/14/563879136/house-gop-tax-plan-would-hit-grad-students-with-massive-tax-hike) and [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/house-tax-bill-graduate-students.html?_r=0&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), for instance) that the new tax plan turns tuition waivers into taxable income, drastically increasing the tax burden for graduate students based on money that they don't even get.

I'm a graduate student myself (in a STEM field), so this topic is of some personal importance to me. However, I have yet to find a news article that details exactly how this is supposed to work. The NYT opinion piece quoted above references that the bill repeals Section 117(d)(5) of the tax code, but that's as specific as I've seen journalists get. It's rare (read: nonexistant) for such pieces to quote directly from the bill or the tax code and no attempt at real legal analysis is ever made.

I call attention to this fact because there was some good discussion on /r/gradschool recently about this bill and there was one (heavily downvoted) user who was unsure that the tax bill would actually have this result. I found [this analysis](https://surlysubgroup.com/2017/11/06/gop-raises-taxes-on-graduate-students-or-does-it/) by a professor at Notre Dame Law School who goes into some detail as to how the bill and tax code interact and he seems similarly unsure. To quote:

> According to Dr. Wilke, the GOP tax bill now requires those tuition waivers to be included in income. After studying the bill and the current statute, this appeared to be true. So, I ran the numbers for a typical graduate student at my institution. You can read my in-depth calculation in the Twitter thread. But essentially, of the $23,000 stipend that a single Notre Dame student receives, he or she would need to pay approximately $13,350 in federal and state income tax, compared with about $2,500 under current law. That makes a graduate education effectively unaffordable.

> Perhaps I’m naïve, but I have trouble believing that the GOP really intends to take away such a large, important benefit from a huge number of students, whose work is critically important to the betterment of this country. Could the GOP have meant only to target the other provisions in section 117(d), which exclude undergraduate tuition waivers from taxation for employees of a university? Are there remaining provisions in the Code that could save the tuition waiver’s tax-free nature? Let’s take a closer look at the proposal.

He goes into some detail in his analysis, but ... it's complicated. I'm not sure I have understood him well enough to summarize accurately, and so I encourage you to simply read his article.

Does anyone here have any insight as to what exactly is going on with Section 1204(a)(3) and how exactly tuition waivers are handled under Section 117 of the [tax code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/117)? I have found mainstream journalism to be incredibly unhelpful in this regard.

682,4jxcps,False,None,150,"Firms like Uber classify drivers as contractors, rather than as employees. Is this business structure legally legitimate, or merely an attempt to get around employment laws?",NeutralPolitics,"Uber, the massive ridesharing company with a current valuation [greater than that of GM]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/12/04/at-68-billion-valuation-uber-will-be-bigger-than-gm-ford-and-honda/#574856a55858), has grown by adopting a rather unique business model. Whereas a traditional firm hires employees to do its work, Uber claims to be a networking service, connecting customers with independent contractors within its network. Following this model, Uber has [grown massively](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0822-uber-revenue-20150822-story.html) in the last several years.

However, widespread opposition to the Uber business model has grown simultaneously. While some applaud Uber for [lowering prices for consumers]( http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/uber-lowers-fares-in-over-100-cities/) by bypassing the artificial constraint on supply created by [taxi medallions]( https://www.thestreet.com/story/13385263/1/the-one-chart-that-should-worry-uber-and-hurts-the-taxi-medallion-short-selling-thesis.html), others have questioned the source of its success. In particular, [some claim that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) far from improving general economic efficiency and social welfare, Uber has become so successful by effectively shifting the burden of many employment costs from themselves to their “contractors”. In the US, as in many other nations, workers are entitled to [a wide number of workplace rights]( https://www.dol.gov/dol/rights-benefits.htm), including mandated breaks, the right to unionize, provision of healthcare benefits and so on. By avoiding direct legal “employment” of drivers, it is argued, Uber lowers costs to itself by making life more miserable for its drivers. 

Indeed, there has been a growing movement among drivers themselves to be recognized as employees precisely to claim the legal protections that come with classical employment, with the entire company now facing a [massive class-action lawsuit](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-appeals-class-action-ruling-in-worker-misclassification-lawsuit/) on the matter; in California, the legal status of Uber drivers as employees [has already been established]( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-labor-commissioner-rules-uber-driver-employee-not-independent-contractor.html). They key point seems to be the legal definition of “contractor”, which is similar in many states. For example, [one author states that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3):

>Under California law, the principal factor in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is whether the employer “to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.”

Uber drivers argue (successfully, in California) that [the degree to which Uber controls its drivers]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) means they are employees, not contractors. However, there is also some evidence that driver discontent may be an isolated phenomenon: one study [has suggested that](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/For-Hire-Vehicle-Transportation-Study.pdf) drivers significantly prefer contracting with Uber over working for traditional cab companies. 

Interestingly, this reclassification of employees as contractors has become [a larger pattern in the American economy that sociologists have named “Uberization”]( http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/18/rise-uberized-economy-means-business/). Thus, the current legal struggle affects not just Uber drivers, but has significant implications for the future of employment across the nation as a whole. 

To summarize: ***Are Uber employment practices legal or not? Do they truly add to the efficiency of the economy, or are they merely transferals of costs? Are the protests of the drivers legitimate?***

The question under consideration by the Supreme Court in *Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v National League* was whether or not the activities of the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs were subject to the Sherman Act.  [The Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Baseball_Club_v._National_League) held that the baseball leagues were not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act because the exhibitions that are baseball games are not trade or commerce as properly understood under the commerce clause.

> Inherent-contempt authority permits the House sergeant-at-arms to arrest the resisting party and bring him or her before the full House for a trial. If adjudicated in contempt, the person can be placed in prison until the contempt is cured or the session of Congress expires. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court in the early 19th century but has not been used since the early 20th century because of its obvious disadvantages and political unpalatability. The House doesn’t even have a prison.

and

> Criminal contempt is initiated by the speaker transmitting a certification of contempt to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Under the pertinent statute, the U.S. attorney is required to present the matter before a grand jury for the return of a felony indictment. Conviction would result in a prison term and/or fine. However, when it is an administration official who is carrying out the president’s policy in disobeying the subpoena, the Justice Department almost certainly will not prosecute.

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has released [an audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842429/ESP-16-03-Final.pdf) (PDF) that faults Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. Here is a [PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/state-department-email-audit-faults-hillary-clinton/) with more information:

*Hillary Clinton and her team ignored clear guidance from the State Department that her email setup broke federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers, an independent audit has found. Her aides twice brushed aside concerns, in one case telling technical staff “the matter was not to be discussed further.”*

*The inspector general’s review also revealed that hacking attempts forced then-Secretary of State Clinton off email at one point in 2011, though she insists the personal server she used was never breached. Clinton and several of her senior staff declined to be interviewed for the State Department investigation.*

Although they do also note that others in the same office have followed similar standards:

*""A spokesman for Clinton, who served as the nation’s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, declared the audit showed her email use was consistent with what others at the department have done.*

*The review encompassed the email and information practices of the past five secretaries of state, finding them “slow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications, particularly as those risks pertain to its most senior leadership.”*

With our recent [META post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4knwqg/meta_reminder_we_reject_submissions_that_are/) in mind about not delving into speculation, can this OIG audit allow for the prosecution of Clinton?

The author of the article focuses primarily on the issue of redistricting based on this information. I was curious about other impacts, such as potential resources being diverted from lower income areas because of the way prisoners are being counted. Are there ways that this can affect areas beyond just the redistricting angle? 

The article is referring to the announcement on 14 February that the Census Bureau will continue the trend of counting prisoners at their location of incarceration, what they deem to be their 'usual residence'. [Their webpage](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html) explains the reasoning behind this.

> The Census Act of 1790 established the concept of “usual residence” as the main principle in determining where people should be counted, and this concept has been followed in all subsequent censuses. “Usual residence” has been defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's voting residence or legal residence.

The article cites a [memo (pdf alert) from the Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/PPI_Demos_2016_FRN_comment.pdf) that lays out an argument for not counting prisoners where they are incarcerated. 

The numbers are not yet out for 2017, but with [a prison population at the end of 2016](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6187) of around 1.5 million people, it is worthy of discussion; looking at the arguments for and against counting prisoners where they are imprisoned and the potential impacts either direction can have on communities

I might have a political bias but to would like to stay focused on factual and legal discussions. I raise the following question/discussion points.

1. The Chinese Communist Party claims the bill is a “serious interference in Chinese affairs.” Is there any legal basis for that statement, or are there any legal definition which defines what is interfering in a country’s internal affairs?

2. The bill is triggered by the massive ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. China [claims the protests in Hong Kong is fuelled to a large extent by “foreign interference”](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3031240/decrying-foreign-interference-china-should) What are, if any, some evidence that the protests are actually a result of foreign interferences?

2. This is not the first time the Chinese Communist Party has raised a finger and told others not to interfere in their internal affairs. Some exhibits [here](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1938622/stop-interfering-hong-kong-affairs-beijing-warns-european), and [here](https://www.cityam.com/top-mp-denies-british-interference-in-hong-kong-after-chinese-ambassadors-warning/amp/). Is there any evidence that the People’s Republic of China under ‘foreign interferences’, or if there’s none, why are they claiming that so often?

3. A little speculative question but I believe it can be answered factually: China has warned US of ‘firm countermeasures’. Without jumping into speculations, what are the current tools and cars on the table that the Chinese Communist Party can use as countermeasures in what they view as interference from a hostile foreign nation?

> “If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility,” Ms. Haley said.

Former Republican diplomat Elliot Abrams briefly touched on an argument for staying, but agreed that the Council's bias against Israel is too much to ignore and leaving is the right decision, saying: 

> “There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,” Mr. Abrams said. “But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.”

716,cge6c3,False,NoAM,131,[META] r/NeutralPolitics needs more moderators! Apply here.,NeutralPolitics,"**EDIT:** The application period is now closed. Thank you to everyone who applied. We'll make an announcement to introduce the new team members when they've been added.

------

Hello everyone! 

Thank you all for the continued support to make this sub the strong community it is. Our sub relies on active, committed, and passionate moderators, and to that end we're putting out an open request for new mod applications to make sure we can keep the discussion at the level you expect.

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend an hour or more reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. Mods read all submissions, and we make an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

We also make heavy use of browser extensions to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.

Other responsibilities include:

* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with the following info:

* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team
* Why you would be a good fit
* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate
* Which forest animal you would be and why

* Do not tell us your political leaning. **Any application that includes such information will automatically be disqualified.**

We look forward to hearing from you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/cge6c3/meta_rneutralpolitics_needs_more_moderators_apply/,359,"""We need more people to censor/delete any threads to the right of Bernie.

Rosentstein [commented on](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-j-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-encryption-united-states-naval) both the practical and constitutional aspects of the issue:

> Encrypted communications that cannot be intercepted and locked devices that cannot be opened are law-free zones that permit criminals and terrorists to operate without detection by police and without accountability by judges and juries.

> [...] there has never been a right to absolute privacy. Courts weigh privacy against other values, including the need to solve and prevent crimes. [...] Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety. [...] There is no constitutional right to sell warrant-proof encryption.

The FBI claims that Papadopoulos' lies prevented them from detaining or arresting Professor Mifsud when he was in the United States.

[From the FBI:](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-george-papadopoulos-sentencing-memo)

>Seventh, the lies were material to the investigation. The defendant’s lies to the FBI in January 2017 impeded the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, **those statements substantially hindered investigators’ ability to effectively question the Professor when the FBI located him in Washington, D.C. approximately two weeks after the defendant’s January 27, 2017 interview**. The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. **The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017** and he has not returned to the United States since then.

How did Papadopoulos' statements hinder the investigators' ability to question Professor Mifsud?

##Papadopoulos' False Statements

>a. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS claimed that his interactions with an overseas professor**, who defendant PAPADOPOULOS understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials, **occurred before defendant PAPADOPOULOS became a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign**. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged that the professor had told him about the Russians possessing ""dirt"" on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of""thousands of emails,"" but stated multiple times that he learned that information prior to joining the Campaign. In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March, and met the professor on or about March 14, 2016; the professor only took interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign; and the professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the ""thousands of emails"" on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant PAPADOPOULOS had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month. 
>
>b. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS further told the investigating agents that the professor was "" a nothing"" and ""just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something.""** In truth and in fact, however, defendant **PAPADOPOULOS understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials** (and had met with some ofthose officials in Moscow immediately prior to telling defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the ""thousands of emails"") and, over a period of months, defendant PAPADOPOULOS repeatedly sought to use the professor's Russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. 
>
>c. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS claimed he met a certain female Russian national before he joined the Campaign and that their communications consisted of emails such as, '""Hi , how are you?""' In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the female Russian national on or about March 24, 2016, after he had become an adviser to the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period ofmonths in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.

I don't know how these talks will turn out, I'm not a fortune teller, but in hearing and reading this news I realized I really didn't know what would happen if the talks fell through and a coalition (whether the Grand Coalition or the Jamaica Coalition) wasn't formed. I'm not familiar with the Grundgesetz, and I don't know what is and isn't possible within the German government, which leads me to my questions:

**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?

**Furthermore, if the existence of minority governments is possible in the German system, what are they like?** Do they share similarities with other nations' minority governments, such as in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, or are German minority governments unlike all others?

The summary is essentially:

- Just like any other parliamentary government, an absolute majority of a party, or a coalition, is not necessary. Instead the ruling party is forced to form temporary coalitions on an issue-by-issue basis. It can go both ways; on the one hand it can make for a very functioning democracy because minorities are involved in legislation, on the other hand it can result in a stalemate.

- If a stalemate is reached, through the process of a ""constructive vote of no-confidence"" the President (not the chancellor) can dissolve the parliament and force a snap election.

It comes down to how likely the ruling party sees its ability to get things done in a minority government, or in the other case whether its cards are better in a snap election. ",2018-01-15 01:28:26

- Potentially makes the judiciary more efficient by reducing the number of cases

- It's hard to enforce and somewhat inefficient to enforce. Before the bill, judges would make this determination now I guess the judge has to tell the police and provide a basis for their claim. It would be hard for routine law enforcement to recognize what a ""frivolous claim"" is, especially with how pleadings work where changing one word or paragraph in the complaint can substantially change the course of the lawsuit. 

Quick thoughts on [HR 985](https://policy.house.gov/legislative/bills/hr-985-fairness-class-action-litigation-act-2017):

- Seems to tighten the requirements to qualify as a ""class"" for a class action lawsuit. Probably will make it a little harder to develop a ""class"" as a whole

- Happy lawyers for class action lawsuits get paid only after all members have been paid. Opens the door for issues surrounding how payments are structured though.

> The coup attempt is very puzzling. For one thing, it seems to have been very poorly planned. For example, most TV channels were left operating and there does not seem to have been an attempt to take Erdogan in. And as I write this, it seemed to be collapsing. Second, it is not clear who would benefit from a coup. The military is no longer the secularist stronghold with a strong esprit de corps and sense of mission it once was. (Hence the widespread theory in Turkey that this was a coup staged by Erdogan himself, designed to pave the way for an Erdogan dictatorship. But this doesn’t quite ring true either, in light of Erdogan’s recent attempts to mend fences with Russia and Israel to strengthen the economy. He must know that even a failed coup would wreak havoc with the economy.)

**Voting Information**

[Elections Canada has detailed information on the logistics of voting.](https://elections.ca/home.aspx)  If you are a Canadian citizen and 18 or older, you are legally entitled to vote.  Early voting, absentee voting, and same day registration are available.

**Change from prior elections: voters who live abroad**  

There is no longer any requirement to have lived in Canada recently to be able to vote.  In January this year, [the Supreme Court ruled](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17446/index.do) that Canadian citizens are entitled to vote at their last address in Canada no matter how long they have been outside the country.  So if you are a long-term Canadian expatriate, you can [apply to be on the International Register of Electors](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=reg/etr&document=index&lang=e) and cast your ballot by mail.

**Change from prior elections: formally organized leader debates.**

Newly formed for this election, the [Leader's Debates Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaders%27_Debates_Commission) is organizing a pair of debates, in English and French, among party leaders.

The English debate is Monday, October 7.

The French debate is Thursday, October 10.

**How elections in Canada work**

There will be a First Past the Post election for [all 338 seats in the House of Commons.](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?dir=ces&document=part1&lang=e&section=res) Each seat represents one geographic district, called a “riding,” which represents a specific area within a province (or in the case of the territories, the entire territory).  Candidates generally affiliate with a political party.  If a single party wins the majority of seats [it will form government by convention.](https://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch01&Seq=2&Language=E)  If no party wins a majority, then parties may negotiate to form a coalition, or the party with a plurality of seats may seek to from a minority government, which it can do as long as it does not lose a vote of no confidence.

A simple google search will show that this claim is supported by a wide variety of sources, many from several years ago (before politics might add extra biases) ([1](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/2014/02/26/study-verizon-paid-no-federal-income-taxes/5852539/), [2](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/25/corporation-tax-rate_n_4855763.html), [3](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/23/big-companies-pay-no-taxes/2480281/)), so there must be at least *some* truth to the claim.

However, [Verizon's CEO recently made a statement that Bernie is entirely incorrect](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/senator-sanders-needs-get-his-facts-straight), and a look a [Verizon's latest SEC 10-K filing](http://verizon.api.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EdgarPro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=GQYoeDso-hr2yxm&ID=11203121) seems to agree with the CEO's claim.

* Bernie isn't directly lying, however.  As pointed out by /u/jacksonmills, Verizon *New York* has not paid any taxes in a while, largely due to repeated losses.

Are we already there?",NeutralPolitics,"I interpret the term ""Presumptive Nominee"" to mean that none of the candidate's competitors have a realistic path to the nomination.  I think it's safe to say that about Hillary at this point, but what about Trump?

In a year like this one, it's different.

Hillary Clinton is considered by many to be the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party because she's widely considered strong enough to defeat any and all contenders. That is based on her substantial support, especially from superdelegates. The Democrats are having a more or less textbook season.

It's a *very different story* on the Republican side. Though Trump has won a lot of support, and seems certain to win a lot more, the major powerbrokers within the party, including those in charge of the convention, broadly reject him and want him gone. And this next detail is extremely important:

*No matter what happens leading up to the convention, they can make that happen if they're really determined to.*

Though there are fussy differences in the details of how each party handles the process, both follow the same broad outlines. And one of those commonalities is that primaries are informative, but *not decisive*. How the primary season goes does not guarantee any particular outcome of the conventions which actually choose and declare the nominees.

States vary in how faithful they hold delegates, but most hold them faithful *only through the first ballot*. After that, most of them are free to vote based on their own judgement. And that's how someone like Trump can be pushed aside even if he were to win the vast majority of delegates leading up to the convention.

More, there is a little-mentioned body in pretty much all large political bodies usually called a Credentials Committee. They are the ones who *certify* the delegates, and no delegate may be seated whom they have not certified. The Credentials Committee is not answerable to delegates or states, and is not bound by primary votes or anything similar. If they reject a delegate, even if fairly elected by primary, that delegate is not seated, and will not vote at the convention.

All major parties have this device, or something that serves a similar purpose, and it's a safety check against popular insanity of the kind that elevates dangerous lunatics to power. Using it is very costly politically, and can have long-term consequences for a party that does. So it's only used very judiciously, and it's rare for qualified delegates not to be certified and seated. But if the RNC feels strongly enough that Trump is a real threat (and not only to them), they have this option.

So the reason Trump is not being called presumptive is that GOP leadership mostly opposes him, no matter how popular he may be among rank and file Republicans.

739,6ng7l1,False,None,12,How has the Magnitsky Act impacted Russian entry into the US? How has it influenced trade negotiations between Russia and the US?,NeutralPolitics,"In 2012, the United States Congress passed a law known as the Magnitsky Act that barred certain Russian citizens from traveling to and entering the United States. The law requires the government to identify Human Rights abusers from Russia, and bar them from entry. 

This act was passed as a clause in one of the first formalized trade agreements with Russia (since the fall of the USSR) where:

> The most immediate effect of the bill would be to formally normalize trade relations with Russia after nearly 40 years. Since the 1970s, commerce between Russia and the United States has been subject to restrictions that were intended to punish Communist nations that kept their citizens from emigrating freely.

* http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/business/global/senate-passes-russian-trade-bill-with-conditions.html?_r=0


The list of Russian leaders that are barred from entry to the US via this act can be found here: 

* https://www.scribd.com/document/134085731/Smrule-of-Law-List


A simplified list can be found here: 

* http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/13/a-guide-to-the-russian-officials-on-the-u-s-magnitsky-list/


[Putin believes that the act is largely political and is used as a tool to control Russian trade negotiations. Putin is a vocal critic of this law as well.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/13/the-putin-obsession-that-led-to-trump-jrs-meeting-215374)


Some discussion questions: 

* How has the Magnitsky Act influenced US-Russia relations? How frequently is it invoked? 

* Or is it keeping high-profile financial criminals and human rights abusers from Russia out of the US? 

* Has it been effective in at least impeding the interests of the people the Magnitsky Act was intended to work on (at least in the US)?

* How has this law impacted Russian entry into the US since the law went into effect? 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6ng7l1/how_has_the_magnitsky_act_impacted_russian_entry/,353,"There are currently 44 individuals sanctioned under the [Magnitsky Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156/text) (P.L. 112-208, enacted in late 2012). As it says in the *FP* article you link to, most of these individuals are fairly low-ranking officials in the Interior Ministry, certainly not Putin confidantes for the most part.

When you refer to ""formalized trade agreements"" you're referring to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a provision in the 1974 Trade Act that denied permanent normal trade relations to countries that restricted emigration (i.e., the then-Soviet bloc). As part of the Magnitsky Act, the application of Jackson-Vanik to Russia was repealed (in other words, trade between the USA and Russia was normalized). So, this was not exactly a ""trade agreement."" It was a unilateral action on the part of the U.S. Congress. It has become customary for Congress to eliminate the application of Jackson-Vanik to countries once they have acceded to the World Trade Organization (see for instance [China in 2001]( https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22398.pdf), [Albania and Kyrgyzstan in 2000]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/434/text)).

So basically, Congress formalized a more-liberal trade regime with Russia while simultaneously mandating sanctions against Russian nationals. If that seems odd, well, the process of deal-making in Congress often involves both sides making concessions. In this case the more trade-focused legislators got their wish on Jackson-Vanik, and in exchange the more human-rights-focused legislators got a new tool with which to exert pressure on Russia.

But this is all, arguably, not as relevant given the developments in U.S.-Russia relations since the enactment of the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky sanctions are much less economically significant than the Ukraine-related sanctions applied in the wake of the Crimea annexation. Magnitsky does not target major oil, gas, construction, and banking firms, whereas the Ukraine-related sanctions under the 2014 and 2015 Executive Orders (EOs) target dozens of major companies in these sectors.

Two things that could result in a much greater impact than Magnitsky, however: (1) The EOs signed after the Crimea annexation and Russian actions in eastern Ukraine and (2) the so-called “[Global Magnitsky Act]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/284/text),” which passed the Senate but stalled in the House in 2015. The EOs ([#13660]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo.pdf), [#13661]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo2.pdf), [#13662]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo3.pdf), and [#13685]( https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo4.pdf)) have resulted in regular sanctions against 160 people and 129 entities (companies, militia groups, etc). Special “sectoral sanctions” (mostly restricting access to financial markets) have been imposed on 278 entities as well.

So, in summary answer to your bullet-point questions:

* The Magnitsky Act has certainly affected U.S.-Russia relations, but probably not nearly as much as disputes over Ukraine, Syria, and alleged election meddling.

* The 44 individuals sanctioned under Magnitsky are probably not likely to come to the United States anyway. It’s largely symbolic in this way, kind of like [Russia applying sanctions on U.S. legislators in 2014]( http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/20/obama-authorizes-new-sanctions-on-russia-over-crimea.html).

* Again, Magnitsky has likely not affected the individuals in question all that much. Some of the people sanctioned under the Ukraine-related EOs, however, may well have found that sanctions “impede their interests.” Wealthy businessmen like Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg own assets all over the world, so their presence on the non-Magnitsky sanction lists likely affected them.

* Again, the Magnitsky-sanctioned individuals are unlikely to have tried to enter to USA, with or without sanctions. But the Ukraine-related sanctions may very well have impeded travel for some of the jet-setter types on the list.

By the way, to reproduce the numbers I cite above for people and entities sanctioned under Magnitsky and the Ukraine EOs: Go to Treasury's ""[Sanctions Search](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/)"" website, select ""MAGNIT"" or one of the ""UKRAINE-EO"" options under ""Program,"" and click ""Search.""

This is covered in the [guidelines,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_neutral-ness) but basically, we moderate by the rules, not by personal opinion. We don't remove content because either we or you don't like it.

744,9961yn,False,None,148,How does Warren anti-corruption bill compare to global policy?,NeutralPolitics,"Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation aimed at curbing corruption and introducing mechanisms to enforce accountability, and to democratize large corporations by mandating % of their boards be elected by employees.

I've heard that there are other OCED with policy attempting to accomplish similar goals, but I don't have good exposure to how those policies work or how they compare to Warren's proposal.

**My primary questions are:**

* How does Warren's bill compare to legislation already in place in other countries (ideally implemented long enough ago to have generated good data)
* Is there any reason based on text of the bill that it will be particularly successful or problematic

Also, this is with the caveat that I understand that in current political environment it is likely DOA on the floor, so this discussion is basically just academic.

So, is illegal immigration really a problem in the US? If so, what are the best solutions?

[This article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431012/fixing-illegal-immigration-five-steps) argues for a strictly enforced kind of ""one strike"" policy, whereby anyone found to have entered the country illegally is thereafter ineligible for any legal status. Along those lines, the non-profit Federation for American Immigration Reform, an ""organization of concerned individuals who believe that our immigration laws must be reformed to better serve the needs of current and future generations,"" issued their [Priorities for the 2017 Presidential Transition,](http://www.fairus.org/news/fair-issues-blueprint-for-true-immigration-reform-in-the-new-administration) which outlines even more extensive measures to address the issue.

On the other hand, [Ron Paul says](https://mises.org/blog/how-solve-illegal-immigration-problem) we simply have to:

> Eliminate incentives for those who would come here to live off the rest of us, and make it easier and more rational for those who wish to come here legally to contribute to our economy. No walls, no government databases, no biometric national ID cards. But not a penny in welfare for immigrants.

Is there evidence suggesting what effect any of these proposals would have on illegal immigration? Have other countries curbed their immigration problems with specific measures like these? Has the US done so in the past?

The relevant piece of the text of [Rule 19](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX) reads:

>No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.

The (very brief) [history](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/censure_cases/090Tillman_Laurin.htm) of Rule 19 is essentially this: during a debate on a bill one Senator accused another of taking a particular position on that bill due to ""improper influences."" The accused Senator, after being informed of what was said, rushed into the Senate chambers, had a short, heated argument, then began having a fistfight with the Senator who made the accusation. After the incident, the Senate created Rule 19.

It's not super clear what ""conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator"" means, but I think saying a Senator once abused his office as a state Attorney General to carry out a program of racist voter suppression probably qualifies.

760,hrxzyq,False,None,74,Do US school districts choosing to be online-only risk violating the 14th amendment equal protection clause?,NeutralPolitics,"[Several large us regions and districts are considering or have actually announced plans to continue online-only learning.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/us/school-reopening-plans-major-cities/index.html)

For example (from the above article):

>California's two largest school districts announced Monday that schools will not open for any in-person instruction when the academic year starts in August, and that students will continue to learn remotely. Los Angeles Unified School District and San Diego Unified School District are the largest school districts to date to forgo any type of in-person instruction.

[In earlier months, online learning presented a clear challenge to many families and areas because of inadequate or non-existent access to internet services.  Districts and governments offered some solutions such as hotspots, but those do not work adequately in rural areas and add significant hardship to families in other areas.](https://edsource.org/2020/more-california-students-are-online-but-digital-divide-runs-deep-with-distance-learning/630456)

>Over the last few weeks, state leaders have said that an estimated one in five California students — approximately [1.2 million](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/20/governor-newsom-announces-cross-sector-partnerships-to-support-distance-learning-and-bridge-the-digital-divide/) — lacked broadband or a computer to access distance learning. The problems are particularly acute in rural areas, where only 34% of households are subscribed to an internet service compared with 78% in urban areas, according to an EdSource analysis of 2018 data.  
>  
>Major progress has already been made as districts, private donors and elected officials rush to get devices to students, but hundreds of thousands of students remain unable to access online learning.

and

>Rural schools are finding mobile WiFi devices don’t work at all for students in some of the most remote parts of the state that lack broadband infrastructure. That’s the case in Del Norte Unified, which consists of 11 schools and is the single district within Del Norte County, which reaches the Oregon border.  
>  
>“A lot of students are in places where there isn’t consistent power, let alone internet,” said Ryan Bahten, director of information network services for Del Norte Unified, located just south of the Oregon border. “These hotspots are a nonstarter for us,” referring to WiFi devices donated by T-Mobile to the California Department of Education.

In the landmark case Brown v Board of Education, the [court opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483/USSC_PRO_347_483_1) seemed to make it clear that equal access to schooling is a constitutionally protected right:

>Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.

The [Norway model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_Norway). (It should be noted that Norway has only 5.2 million people, is not very multicultural, and has a highly educated population. Its people are pretty amendable to its criminal justice model.)

The bill is a reaction to legislation from my home county, Washtenaw, which enacted a [10-cent bag tax for paper and plastic](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/06/10-cent_bag_tax_at_washtenaw_c.html).

**Is there a legitimate reason to preemptive block municipalities from passing taxes on undesirable containers such as plastic bans?**

My research is below.
Washtenaw County hoped to address two main issues with the ordinance:

* To offset the costs of processing plastic bags, which it estimated at $219k [per year](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf) (the tax would bring in an estimated $220k [per year](http://www.wastedive.com/news/update-michigan-becomes-seventh-state-to-outlaw-bag-bans/426773/))
* To reduce plastic bags in the environment to mitigate harmful environmental effects, such as the fact that plastic bags take [1,000 years to degrade](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf)

3 potential arguments for the State level legislation:

**Plastic bag bans hurt business**
Los Angeles County California banned plastic bags and charged a $.10 fee for paper bags. They found a 100% reduction in plastic bags, a 25% reduction in paper bags and a [minimal impact on most businesses](http://ladpw.org/epd/aboutthebag/PDF/Bag%20Ban%20Status%20Nov%202012.pdf).

**The taxes are regressive, they hurt the poor more**
This one does have merit. An impact assessment concluded that an average family uses 720 plastic bags at grocery stores [per year](https://conservingnow.com/plastic-bag-consumption-facts/) 720 x .$10/bag = $72/year in taxes.

**Don't tell me what kind of bag to use!**

In the spirit of this sub, I cannot stress enough that I'm really seeking out actual evidence with cited facts if any of you decide to answer. I'm just not restating this because it's a new topic which in turn leads to a lot of banter with more emotion than facts.

Sanders official statement on the event uses this wording:

>At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.  Among other things:

> * The chair of the convention announced that the convention rules passed on voice vote, when the vote was a clear no-vote. At the very least, the Chair should have allowed for a headcount.

> * The chair allowed its Credentials Committee to en mass rule that 64 delegates were ineligible without offering an opportunity for 58 of them to be heard. That decision enabled the Clinton campaign to end up with a 30-vote majority.

> * The chair refused to acknowledge any motions made from the floor or allow votes on them.

> * The chair refused to accept any petitions for amendments to the rules that were properly submitted.

Edit: Feeling the need to clarify that I am aware that the data is utterly unambiguous that masks are effective, and that mandating them seems a small matter when stacked up next to other temporary emergency measures like Japanese internment, WWII food rations, the PATRIOT act, etc. Yet these are almost always enacted at a state or federal level, not city or county, so I'm especially curious what systems are in place for endowing power to local government when more centralized government doesn't act, or conversely what limits are in place for such situations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/horfw8/do_mayors_and_county_boards_have_the_authority_to/,335,[removed] ,2020-07-10 15:55:15

http://www.joshuakennon.com/thoughts-bernie-sanders-tax-economic-proposal/

From the perspective of someone without much formal background in tax or economics, it seems to bring up a lot of fair points: 

> ""An estimated 45% of the tax revenue Sanders wants to raise comes from these offensive and onerous levies on working families, not the rich alone.""

> ""if you are self-employed, before we’ve even gotten to the other tax changes he wants to make, you are now looking at sending more than 1/5th of your income to the Federal government and you still wouldn’t have paid a penny of Federal, state, or local income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes.""
> 
> ""By the time all is said and done, even accounting for the supposed free college and health care that Sanders is promising his voters, the discretionary purchasing power of nearly every family in this country, rich and poor alike, would be lowered, in some cases by double-digit percentages.""


It's a bit of a long read (with a big ""preamble""), and there are many more criticisms than what I quoted here.

778,1cfxnq,False,None,27,[META] Please assume good faith and moderate your tone when commenting,NeutralPolitics,"We've received a handful of messages from OPs who have left the sub as a result of the kinds of comments that they receive on their posts. As such, we'd like to take some time to look at good and bad ways to respond to posts. Even if you assume good faith already, I invite you to read this post so that you can help encourage it in the future.

In /r/NeutralPolitics, we believe that assuming good faith is **vital** to having good discussion. When someone posts something we disagree with, we find that the best way to deal with it is with a reasoned, fact based reaction, as opposed to an angry (even if fact based) reaction. Here are a few good guidelines for responding:

* Assume that OP misunderstands the issue before assuming willful ignorance or malice. Many people post here because they are unaware of the arguments against them, and want to find out what those are.
* Woo the OP to ""your side"", don't chastise them for holding an opinion you disagree with. You'll catch more flies with honey than with flame wars.
* Avoid *ad hominem* attacks. If your post contains a lot of ""I"" and ""You"", you're probably talking about the OP, not the issue. This is often a sign of a weak argument, since if you have a good argument, talking about the issue should be enough to persuade someone.
* Please do not use sarcasm or rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions can only have negative consequences, they never contribute towards good dialogue. Sarcasm can only inflame, it can't inform.

Let's look at an example. Say I made a post about a controversial issue, like this:

>I think that the US should stop funding public education. Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt. [sources about teacher salaries and the national debt]

Now, depending on your views, you may feel very angered by this admittedly poorly worded and simplistic post. Many top level comments would probably look like this:

>""I think that the US should stop funding public education."" Yeah, sure. And maybe we should stop paving roads while we're at it, since that would reduce the deficit too.

>""Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt."" Teachers are paid a pittance [source]. If you think being a teacher is so easy, why don't you try being one?

When you have 20 replies like this in your inbox, it can be stressful to try and read through them and respond. Here's a much more constructive way to argue against the OP.

>Education is actually a pretty small part of the national budget [source]. Not to mention that American teachers are paid way less than teachers in other developed countries [source]. Studies [source] have shown that public education leads to a more skilled population that can better compete in a global marketplace. If Americans are earning more money, we can pay back the debt faster.

>Do you still feel that education is a waste of federal budget? If so, why?

Something to note here: After attempting to persuade the reader with their argument, this commenter invites honest feedback on whether they've been convincing, and allows the OP (or any reader) to change their view without shaming them for the views they may have held before. This is key.

There's already a lot of good faith discussion here, and it warms my cold, reasoned, fact-based blood-pump.

780,2y2dpb,False,None,242,"Besides goods, what can China export to maximize its global influence?""",NeutralPolitics,"Globalization is commonly viewed in respect to the spread of western values on other countries. In this sense, U.S. products and pop culture tend to infiltrate other markets and are perceived as being American values. (plenty of food, Hollywood and the perception it gives other countries about the U.S., consumerism)

It seems China's main goal is to spread its economic influence in other countries. The case of China's investments in Africa are a good example of this. [This opinion page](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/opinion/into-africa-chinas-wild-rush.html) gives an overview of China's investments and some of the negative effects it has led to. 

>In much of Africa, they have set up huge mining operations. They have also built infrastructure. But, with exceptions, they have done so using equipment and labor imported from home, without transferring skills to local communities. So China takes our primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism.”

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/opinion/chinas-limited-influence.html) highlights some issues with Chinese soft power in its current state.

>In today’s media-driven world, soft power is another crucial element of superpower influence. Yet, beyond the inaccessibility of China’s language for most foreigners and their indifference to its social trends, China’s political and economic systems have little appeal in other countries. Its state capitalist economic model attracts political leaders looking to build wealth and micromanage markets, but it offers little for ordinary citizens.


Economic domination has played a huge role in maintain western supremacy, but cultural values have been a huge part of maintaining the status quo. The spread of english language has been a big factor in maintaining this as well, as it keeps the U.S. accessible to all countries. While the two are always linked, it's been hard to find articles that discuss the spread of Chinese culture, if there has been any.

Can Chinese culture compete with centuries of western influence? As the article mentioned language is probably the biggest barrier to spreading influence, but are there other ways? Have they taken any action to export values that are in contrast to western culture?  If not, are there values that would be beneficial in increasing Chinese soft power?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/2y2dpb/besides_goods_what_can_china_export_to_maximize/,329,[removed] ,2015-03-05 21:24:39

The feature shows that Trump sent 33 nominations to the Senate, higher than recent presidents, including Clinton and both Bushes, but lower than Obama. Since then, he has named 28 more to executive branch positions. This still leaves many departments without a Deputy Secretary named, including State, Labor, Interior, and Education. Is this typical of an administration in its first few months, or are lower-level positions (e.g. deputy and assistant secretaries) in Cabinet departments filled more quickly?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/622vwk/is_the_pace_of_president_trumps_cabinet/,334,"Despite all the news stories about this, it appears that he is following a relatively similar timeline, perhaps slightly slower.

[This Vox article (obviously left-leaning)](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/16/14616114/trump-nominations-pace) mentions that it's mostly deputies that do the day-to-day running of the organization, but my suspicion is that those policies are run by the actual Secretary, hence the urgency of getting them in place (also it looks good to have the leader in place.)

The stated goal of the order is to ensure that meat processing facilities remain open.  They have done so based on the [Defense Production Act](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1650-20490-5258/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf), specifically, section 101 and 101(b).

In the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.

What does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?

The Constitution gives the people the tools required to fight established institutions and even stage a revolution without breaking the system.

Some simple calculations:

$150 billion over 10 years = $15 billion per year

$15 billion / 24 million uninsured = $625 saved per person per year

Obviously this is an estimate. But supposing that it's at least roughly correct, can this be interpreted as saying that it would cost the US government $625 to insure one of those individuals for a year? This strikes me as relatively cheap, considering that [monthly premiums are roughly $393 for individuals](https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) -- so cheap that I think my line of reasoning must be flawed.

The Washington Post highlights that this plan would raise around 15.3 Trillion over the next decade and obviously lead to increase of taxes across the board. The average increase would be around $9000 per household, though that mainly comes from the highest earners in America paying the most with the average increase for the middle class would be around 4700.

I can't be bothered to figure this out state by state, so going by total numbers (which is clearly not perfect due to Clinton winning the popular vote); Clinton received 65,844,610 votes. Trump received 62,979,636 votes. Source:

https://splinternews.com/here-is-the-final-popular-vote-count-of-the-2016-electi-1793864349

I then discovered there was a difference between total number of registered voters (people who can vote) and total number of people who could hypothetically vote (if they register).

I decided to try and find the total number of registered voters first. 

Which brings us to now. After dismissing a few sources because they were vague in their definitions, and their numbers were surprisingly high (i assumed they were giving me the total number of voting age people who could hypothetically vote if registered). I found two seemingly credible sources for numbers:

https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/how-many-registered-voters-are-in-america-2016-229993

That source explicitly says registered voters in late 2016 was just over 200m.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/273743/number-of-registered-voters-in-the-united-states/

And that source gives the number specifically for the 2016 election at 157m.

I thought maybe the first source was the number that registered after the election, but the second source gives the number of registered voters at the 2018 elections at 153m. I doubt the number went from 157 to 200 to 153 in two years.

Which of these sources are known to be reliable or unreliable? As you can see it would make the difference regarding my original question, whether the number of people who could, but didn't, vote, would have made a difference.

Or which alternate sources are known to be reliable or unreliable?

(This is clearly being cheeky, but if anyone wants to do the work for me and source your findings, that'd work too...?)

Kinda busy tonight though, but I'll sort through all those sources when i have some time. Especially thanks to u/leonkennedy74 I'm going to be giving some thought to how possible this hypothesis actually is in the current system.

Edit 2: The reason i started where i did is from a statement i made, and then tried to find out if it's true; that if everyone who could have voted did, but for a third party candidate, we'd now have a three party system.

811,c2kk0d,False,None,184,What are the arguments for/against the regulation of service-animals?,NeutralPolitics,"[Service animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_animal) have long been used by persons to assist with disabilities, both physical and mental. In the United States, there is no official registry of service animals. Per [ADA rules](https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm), companies are limited to questions they may ask regarding service animals:

> When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.

A recent situation is when emotional support animals are being claimed as being applicable under the ADA. These emotional support animals are not required to be trained, which has led to several incidents, most notably with regards to air travel where emotional support animals are exempted from pet travel fees and storage restrictions.


[Emotional support dog attacks man on plane.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/05/29/an-emotional-support-dog-attacked-him-flight-hes-suing-delta-owner/?utm_term=.fd19627a59ee)

[Accommodating service animals is also an issue for landlords](https://archives.hud.gov/news/2013/servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf), who are required by the ADA to accommodate service animals despite the landlord having an otherwise no-pet policy, which can include emotional support animals. However, it is [incredibly easy to get an animal certified as an emotional support animal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animals-and-us/201406/service-animal-scams-growing-problem), to the extent that you can get a certificate over the internet for less than a hundred dollars.


Those opposed to increased regulations of service-animals present the argument that creating such a system [would be detrimental to the disabled](https://blog.easterseals.com/illinois-service-dog-law-hb-3162/).

> Not all individuals with a disability have easy access to a medical doctor, and some cannot afford a visit to a medical doctor. A person with a diagnosed seizure disorder, for example, might not see a doctor regularly and making a doctor’s appointment just to get an official letter could be expensive.

> The requirement to get this license and equipment to identify an animal as a service dog. What costs fall upon the individual with the disability (a fee to apply, the cost of a vest or harness that is specially made)? What costs are required of the taxpayer to fund someone to test dogs and hand out licenses? Cost and confidentiality for the person with the disability is a huge concern – and one the ADA intended to avoid as it does not require medical documentation or vests for dogs.

> The obedience and skills required are too subjective

[The costs of owning a service animal are significant](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/health/22patient.html), and roughly seventy percent percent of disabled persons are unemployed, so even small increases in cost can put a service animal out of reach of many disabled persons who could benefit from them.

This position of the left makes sense when approaching the subject from the world view of my country's politics, where they're often seen as parts (not necessarily in agreement, but still) of the same side, but it doesn't make any sense when talking specifically about the US, where both are frequently seen as parts of a dichotomy.

So, I ask: Who/what exactly is this dichotomy addressing? Can it be adequately juxtaposed to a left-right dichotomy?

&#x200B;

\*I am not implying that they always come together, (in fact, Instituto Liberal, the ""Liberal Institute"", published an article saying that [there is no such thing as a liberal conservative](https://www.institutoliberal.org.br/blog/nao-existe-liberal-conservador-2/) as Amoedo suggested) just that they're both seen as part of the right",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/a92z8p/the_conservatives_vs_liberals_opposition_outside/,319,"IMO they both rely on their built up and compromised tribal identities. (liberals are progressive socialists n conservatives traditional capitalists). In today's terms they are a whisper of what they were as propaganda bends the founding values to corporate interests. Eg. Both are largely compromised by the Federal reserve, military industry, AIPAC and many other politicized groups (less so NATO now). Both political parties are built on the history of relevant power structures (English administration etc). The generalizations that come with conservatives being more so traditionalists, Christian and land owners etc are themes the Republicans play on. Whilst the democrats play on being socially progressive and promoting values for liberty. Ohh how the veil of empire shrouds peoples opinions.  ",2018-12-24 07:34:04
815,92v2k7,False,None,89,What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?,NeutralPolitics,"This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.

Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a
Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit  electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.^2

The bill itself can be found online [here](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2383/BILLS-115s2383is.pdf), and is not that long of a read. The gist of the bill is that it is amending the Stored Communications Act to fix problems that the proponents claim are in American internet-related laws. 

[Andrew Woods and Peter Swire writing at Lawfare Blog](https://lawfareblog.com/cloud-act-welcome-legislative-fix-cross-border-data-problems) support the legislation, saying things like 

>Moreover, a number of safeguards are built into the bill. The bill creates a mechanism whereby providers can apply for a motion to quash or modify legal process if the provider reasonably believes the subscriber is not a U.S. person and that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. It also requires a court to conduct a comity analysis in the event of such a motion to quash, which may alleviate foreign government concerns about sovereign interests. It is not clear why this comity provision is in the statute except as a symbolic gesture; courts were already free under the common law to conduct a comity analysis in thinking through whether to issue an order with extraterritorial impact. Its presence in the statute is perhaps a reminder that trust and mutual respect play an important role in these cross-border matters. 

The EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation - [opposes the bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), stating its issues with the law: 

>The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act expands American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to target and access people’s data across international borders in two ways. First, the bill creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.

What is the most likely or most viable way that the US federal government could ban a website (or app) without requiring a new law from Congress?

What challenges would that ban face?

Bonus question: What tends to be the threshold(s) that a Chinese owned company must exceed (% of Chinese ownership, activities, proof of censorship, proof of embedded CCP members, etc) for that company or their products to receive sanction-like actions from the US that go beyond standard regulations?

# Context

US White House administration confirmed that WeChat and TikTok [are each facing scrutiny in the US](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/) and the administration is threatening to ban them.

Every major internet censorship initiative that I know of at the national level [are acts of congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States#Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_(CFAA)).

Even the best explanations I can find about how a ban would work cast significant doubt on any options that do not need congressional approval:

* US Commerce Department could put TikTok on its [""entity"" list](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list)  but the US government blocking traffic to TikTok is ""unlikely to succeed given our legal systems.""
*  The administration has limited authority to ban outright any specific piece of software, like an app. EFF general council says ""There is no law that would authorize the federal government to ban ordinary American from using an app.""
* A law or executive order that targets TikTok could spur a challenge under the First Amendment using rulings such as [Bernstein v. DOJ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech), in which the court found a computer scientist had the First Amendment right to publish an encryption algorithm. 
* ""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is [already investigating TikTok](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-launches-a-national-security-review-of-tiktok-report/) for national security concerns...could end up requiring changes to TikTok's substantial operations inside the US."" But that started in November 2019, and its not clear to me when that wraps up and what impact it can have in the grand scheme of things.

3: Is there any evidence the prosecutors and the Israeli Ministry of Justice hold an unworkable bias against Netanyahu or are 'framing' him?

[This Politico article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670) describes what they found after looking at where the money goes.

On the one hand:

> According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which were obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the participants. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties.

And then directly the next paragraph:

> But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating officer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the DNC, which Sanders’ supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton campaign.

The Justice Department has at times released evidence directly relating to an investigation that did not produce any criminal charges. 

For example, the Justice Department and FBI [released interview summary reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi.html) (commonly called 302s) for people charged with no crimes in the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

I have a couple questions:

1: What exactly is the Justice Department policy on releasing investigative evidence when no criminal charges are filed? Is it well codified?

2: House Republicans successfully petitioned the Justice Department for 302 interview summary reports even though no charges were filed in the Clinton email case. Is this now established precedent, and will the Justice Department  have to hand over similar information in regards to the Mueller investigation?

Generally, the DOJ wouldn’t release collected evidence that they didn’t deem worthy of criminal charges, which makes sense (and this is why the whole Clinton debacle was so widely publicized/criticized). However, the Mueller investigation (or any  DOJ investigations of a sitting president) poses an additional conundrum to this. 

If it is DOJ policy to never indict a sitting president, then that could (would?) mean that any evidence they collected during said investigation would get withheld until that President was no longer in office, regardless of how damning it was. So effectively, this would mean that while a president is in office he is immune to federal charges.

AFAIK, there really isn’t an answer to this as none of it has ever been tested or approached  ",2019-03-19 15:19:06

That being said - the past 48 hours have featured as many as ten women, through various news outlets ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-new-york-times-allegations-229705), [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0)), accusing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a sexual assailant, in various forms.

Per usual, even these allegations have seen reactions along party lines (unfortunately), and while many jump to the defense of Trump due to various reasons, many more have simply convicted him in the court of public opinion.

Here's my question: These allegations, both in the case of Donald Trump and in former president and known-philanderer Bill Clinton, consist of multiple variables that would make them somewhat difficult to prosecute - specifically time. Many of these women are 40, 50, 60+ years old and are speaking on incidents that allegedly happened years ago.

Is there a statute of limitations on these crimes? What sort of evidence would be necessary to actually label one of these men a sexual predator? Would Donald Trump have a libel case against any of these accusers should they lack a preponderance of evidence?

Most importantly - who has the burden of proof in these scenarios? Is it on the accused to prove innocence in the face of countless accusations that no doubt have a timely element? Or do we place the burden on the accuser - who likely has been through a mental struggle in their path to facing these crimes?

This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.

There exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military. Shamila Chaudhary, who was an official under the Obama administration and now is an adviser at Johns Hopkins, [describes](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632673383/opinion-imran-khan-has-declared-victory-in-pakistans-election-but-the-military-w?t=1532734461945): 

>But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate.

>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.

>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.

Pakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016.

**How have states dealt differently with this instability and the balance between military and civilian power?** Some states have had decades since their last coup, others have had them in the last few years.

850,h9uvui,False,None,45,Policy Successes of Black Lives Matter Organization,NeutralPolitics,"**EDIT:** While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked. In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the ""Black Lives Matter organization"" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.

In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).

Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times: 

> ""ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic

> presidential primary season. (ActBlue confirmed that racial justice
> causes and bail funds had led the way.) The site’s four biggest days
> ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250
> million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus
> weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation
> ticker.""

That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the ""integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""

The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their ""About"" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the ""[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)"" ""[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)"" and ""[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)"" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c. June 13, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613093333/https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/) for posterity).

This leads me to wonder:

1) Has the Black Lives Matter organization been responsible for changes in policy at the local, state, or federal level in pursuance of their mission?

2 ) If so, what are those changes, and is there any evidence that they have successfully brought the locality, state, or country wherein they were enacted closer to the organization's vision?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/h9uvui/policy_successes_of_black_lives_matter/,303,[removed] ,2020-06-16 02:43:09

859,b4729v,False,None,38,Does Trump’s free speech executive order affect conservative Christian universities' long-standing policies of privileging Christian views?,NeutralPolitics,"On Thursday, US President Trump [signed](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/435183-trump-signs-executive-order-aimed-at-protecting-free-speech-on) an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-free-inquiry-transparency-accountability-colleges-universities/) about free speech on college campuses. The order will [“withhold federal funding from public and private colleges and universities that do not protect free speech on campuses”](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-campus-free-speech).

Many say that this is a move by conservatives to protect against the suppression of conservative views on college campuses—the existence of which is a separate question. However, one might consider how this executive order might actually protect against suppression of non-conservative, non-Christian, or non-heteronormative speech on conservative Christian colleges and universities—e.g., [Liberty University](http://www.liberty.edu/media/1312/hr_formsmanager_forms/Signoff%20for%20Doctrine,%20Ethics,%20&%20Harassment-full%20version%20(01-2015).pdf).

After all, some conservative Christian universities accept federal funds (, e.g., from tuition payments provided by federal [aid](https://www.christiancolleges.com/resources/financial-aid-for-christian-colleges/) or [grants](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111109/grove-city-college-v-bell/).

However, many of these universities regulate not only speech, but also beliefs: They explicitly require faculty and staff to sign faith statements (see “Employment Practices” [here](https://www.cccu.org/institutions/) or an example of a statement [here](http://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/index.cfm?PID=6907)). This clearly and systematically requires certain speech and prevents speaking opportunities from atheists, non-Christian religions, and people with certain sexual identities/preferences, etc.—a clear violation of the executive order's attempt to ""promote free and open debate on college and university campuses.""

And many Christian universities do not hide this attempt to regulate speech. They celebrate the fact that they privilege conservative and/or Christian views over others in their curricula/classrooms/events with statements like, [“we integrate a Christian perspective into everything we do”](https://www.biola.edu/student-life). Indeed that might be what conservative Christian students (and/or their parents) find so appealing about the universities: they like the idea of a [“safe environment”](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/students/spiritual-growth/) where young impressionable minds can be protected from atheist/non-Christian/secular speech.

The White House claims that [“private schools \[need only\] follow their own policies, and the executive order will not impact student tuition aid programs”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-colleges-idUSKCN1R22G0). However, in the past, private Christian universities that seek to maintain their own policies have had to either forgo accepting public funding from students or else seek a religious exemption—e.g., from Title IX standards: see [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/the-controversial-reason-some-religious-colleges-forgo-federal-funding/490253/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/591140811/christian-colleges-are-tangled-in-their-own-lgbt-policies). 

So, on the one hand, if the executive order truly ""ensure\[s\] institutions that receive Federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, **including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies**"" (such as Title IX), then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges' and universities' practice of privileging certain speech and inhibiting other speech (emphasis added; see Section 3 of the executive order).

But, on the other hand, if the order allows private campuses to regulate speech of certain people on the basis of religion or sexuality after all, then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges eligibility for certain federal, state, and local funding—e.g., due to Title IX.

Either way, this executive order creates challenges for some private Christian universities in the US. 

# Questions

1. How is this analysis mistaken, if at all?
2. What challenges to Christian universities' speech policies and practices are actually created by this executive order, if any?

[This paper](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/jmantel/health-regulatory-process/StateandFederalRolesinHealthCare.pdf) (PDF) discusses the State and Federal roles in providing healthcare. The authors lay out some arguments for each:

* Federal: Some problems are inherently national concerns. Some problems require the fiscal power of the federal government. Some problems require wealth redistribution, which is best carried out by the federal government. Federal government has historically been seen as less prone to corruption and scandal.
* State: Federal government can be inefficient. Some problems are inherently local, including local values. Decentralizing government control promotes civic engagement. State level policies will have a better understanding of local organizations that are effected.


[Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_health_care_reform), [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigo_Health), and [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SustiNet_\(Connecticut\)) all have created state-level healthcare.

867,1fuw7l,False,None,76,Is protecting America the same thing as protecting Americans?,NeutralPolitics,"*[I'm going to preface this post by admitting that I have a definite position on this issue, and although I try not to let that get in the way of considering opposing views, I concede in advance that I have a bias.]*

In reading [this article,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22809541) where the US Director of National Intelligence justifies recently revealed government intrusions into private communications, I noticed him make a very common conflation of two concepts that sound similar, but I propose to be distinct: **protecting America versus protecting *Americans*.**

The programs the director is defending are presumably counter-terrorism efforts. But in order to accept that thwarting terrorism is equivalent to protecting America, you have to believe that terrorist plots represent an existential threat to the nation. That means the potential attacks would be a coordinated effort likely to kill many millions of citizens, cripple our infrastructure, defeat our military and compromise our government institutions all at once. [The evidence doesn't support that terrorism rises to this level.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html)

The Soviet Union, with its bellicose threats and thousands of nuclear-tipped ICBMs aimed at the US, represented an existential threat to the nation. Imperial Japan, having invaded dozens of lands in a steady, five-year march across the Pacific, culminating in a full-scale aerial assault on a US naval base, represented an existential threat to the nation. Nazi Germany, having conquered half of Europe in just two years, and with its submarines attacking US shipping within sight of the East coast, represented an existential threat to the US.

Instead, what I think the Director is saying — probably without recognizing a distinction — is that these terrorists are a threat to American *lives.* But that's not the same thing. The loss of American lives, tragic as it is, does not in itself represent a threat to the nation.

In fact, it could be argued that the best way to protect America — traditionally the land of freedom, liberty, and justice under the law — would be to eliminate all these domestic surveillance programs, targeted killings, indefinite detention and the other associated anti-terrorism measures, because they themselves are a bigger threat to the American way of life than anything a terrorist can muster. But if we accept that terrorism does represent *some* level of threat (albeit not existential), supporting a reduction in counter-terrorism efforts means we would accept higher risk to our personal safety in exchange.

So, the question then becomes, are you willing to slightly increase the risk to your life in order to protect what it means to be American, or do you believe that it's the responsibility of the military to protect American lives, potentially at the cost of the American *way* of life?

-----

I'd like to make two observational side notes here: 

1. Reddit's readership skews decidedly young. If you were born after roughly 1988, America has been on a war footing since you were a teenager. You probably have no personal memory of what American society felt like prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. There was no TSA, no Patriot Act, no warrantless wiretaps, no Department of Homeland Security, no prison at Guantanamo Bay, no drones, no ""Homeland"" or ""24,"" and most importantly, terrorism was generally seen as something that happened far away. For you folks, defending ""the American way of life"" may seem like a foreign concept, because for your entire adult life, this is the way America has been. I'm making some broad assumptions here, and I'm sure not everyone falls into this category, but as an older redditor, I want to point out that a large portion of the population remembers what it felt like to live in a country where the recently revealed government intrusions would have been considered a shocking overreach, rather than part and parcel of an extensive security mindset.
2. The traditional job of the US military has been to protect the nation from *existential threats,* while it's the role of law enforcement agencies to protect *American lives.* One of the reasons we don't involve the military in law enforcement tasks is because they have the tendency to view everything, including the citizens, as a threat.

[SCOTUS ON PHONE PRIVACY CASE](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/362450-overnight-tech-scotus-considers-phone-tracking-apples-new)

""Members of the Supreme Court appeared troubled Wednesday that police can search cellphone location histories without a warrant, but struggled with where the line should be drawn on privacy in the digital age… Carpenter says the FBI violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure by obtaining a history of his cellphone location data without a warrant from his wireless carriers, MetroPCS and Sprint. The government then used that information at trial to convict him…   The standard is higher to obtain a warrant, with law enforcement officers required to show there is probable cause to believe a crime has occurred.""

[The **Liberal-Conservative Alliance** on the Supreme Court Against Digital Surveillance](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/bipartisanship-supreme-court/547124/)

""On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard what could become the most important electronic-privacy case of the 21st century. The justices considered whether the government, without a warrant, can effectively trace our movements in public for months on end by demanding 127 days of the geolocational data—known as cell-site location information—that mobile phones beam out 24 hours a day. During the argument, it was encouraging to see two justices with very different perspectives—Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch—make passionate arguments for why allowing these kinds of mass searches of our digital effects would be as invasive and unreasonable as the hated general warrants that helped spark the American Revolution. It’s possible, therefore, that Carpenter v. United States may continue a welcome recent trend: Liberal and conservative justices on the Court, by broad bipartisan margins, are insisting on translating the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution into the digital age.

Justice Elena Kagan framed the stakes in the case by asking Michael Dreeben, the deputy solicitor general, how this case was different from United States v. Jones, a 2012 case where the government tracked a suspect for a month without a warrant by clamping a Global Positioning System device on the bottom of his car. Five justices, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that the police violated the suspect’s property rights by committing a physical trespass for the purpose of collecting information—they walked onto his driveway and physically seized his car… Dreeben responded that the Jones case involved government surveillance in public, while in this case, the government was seizing business records that individuals had voluntarily turned over to their third-party cellphone carriers, who stored them in the digital cloud. A 1979 case called Smith v. Maryland held that individuals have no expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers they voluntarily surrender to third parties, establishing what is now known as the third-party doctrine.""

""Given these ambiguities, with respect to evidence in criminal investigations CSLI is often far more useful as an exculpatory mechanism than as a mechanism to establish guilt. After all, CSLI can help show that a suspect was dozens or hundreds of miles away from a crime scene. But it can’t generally establish that a suspect was actually at a crime scene. Even in the case where the suspect was actually in the building of interest when a crime occurred, CSLI can at best help show that the suspect, as well as perhaps thousands of other people, was within a few miles, or a half a mile, or a few hundred yards (the precision depends on the size of the area served by the base station in question) of the crime scene… CSLI provides only a very approximate estimate of the actual location of the phone. For example, it might be possible to know that the phone is within a mile or two of a particular base station, but that wouldn’t be enough to place the phone in a particular building, on a particular street, or even in a particular neighborhood. On the other hand, if the mobile phone happens to be connected to a base station that serves a much smaller area, that would provide correspondingly more accurate location information.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7tm9be/is_the_monitoring_of_your_cell_phone_legal_does/,297,"I don’t think it matters whether it is “legal” or not I honestly think they will use what ever technology at their disposal to gather information.

870,4cxx7m,False,None,91,[META] r/NeutralPolitics is going into lockdown mode and restructuring,NeutralPolitics,"**This is not an April Fools joke!**

Dear users,

From 5:00 p.m. EST today until the morning of April 4th, /r/NeutralPolitics will be in ""lockdown"" mode for restructuring. This meta post, and the various other meta posts linked within, describes what we're doing and why.

(Again, not an April Fools joke.)

--------

**What the lockdown means:**

* Mods will approve no new submissions from now until Monday morning.
* All posts from the previous seven days will be locked until Monday morning. Mods will use the interim period to clean up discussions in those posts to make sure the comments comply with the rules.
* This series of meta posts will stay open so users and mods can interact.

----------

**Why we're doing what we're doing.**

r/NeutralPolitics has a long history of encouraging a certain type of discussion that's not found in many other places on the internet. If you're not familiar with that history, [reading about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) might help you understand our larger goals.

In the last few months, this subreddit has undergone an unprecedented period of subscriber growth and it has brought about a shift in the tone of discussion. That has prompted increasing complaints from the users, which fall roughly into two camps.

Users who are accustomed to the discussion environment we have built over the last four years (we'll call them 'Group A') have complained repeatedly to the mods about the:

* Decline in comment quality.
* Decline in vigilance of policing comments for citations.
* Increase in ""eloquent opinions parading themselves as facts."" (Thanks to a specific user for this apt description.)
* Comments that should be removed for rule violations are instead upvoted by a large number of readers.
* Diminished participation from users who used to contribute well-sourced insights that counter the common narratives.

Meanwhile, other participants (who we'll call 'Group B') complain the rules and enforcement are *too* strict to allow the kind of freeform discussions they find on other subreddits, websites, facebook, at dinner tables, etc. Some of the comments we've received from these users are:

* ""I think"" statements shouldn't require a source. It's just personal opinion.
* Concepts that are, or should be, common knowledge don't require a citation. Everyone knows what their definitions are.
* Speculation is useful, even if it can't be supported with evidence.
* These rules are stifling discussion.

Past waves of growth have been accompanied by similar adjustment and complaint periods, but in all those cases, the Group A folks have vastly outnumbered those from Group B. This time is different. The split of opinions is roughly even now, which means there's a sizable portion of our users who want a discussion environment with more relaxed rules.

This has put us at a crossroads. We have to decide what kind of subreddit we want to be.

After careful consideration, the mods have concluded that adjusting the sub to accommodate Group B would be throwing in the towel on creating the evidence-based environment outlined in our [mission statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_mission_statement), which we're not quite ready to do yet.

Instead, we've decided to launch an outlet specifically for those users. /r/NeutralTalk is a new subreddit based on the rules of /r/NeutralPolitics, but with a few key restrictions eliminated to allow more freeform and speculative discussions. [The official announcement is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvs8/meta_announcing_neutraltalk_a_companion_sub_to/) We encourage you to check it out.

In the meantime, /r/NeutralPolitics, will undergo a *tightening* of the rules, and especially enforcement, in an effort to bring quality back in line with what our long-time users expect and to entice quality contributors back to the discussions.

The following concepts are all outlined in the rules already, but we'll be focusing on more strict enforcement from here on: 

* Prefacing a comment with ""I think"" does not absolve you of the need to support your assertions with logic and evidence. If you're making a claim, you need to make a case for that claim. There are myriad sites on the internet (including /r/NeutralTalk) where you can state your personal opinion without the need for evidentiary support. This isn't one of them.
* ""Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith."" What may seem ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" to you is often not to others. In fact, the most obvious conclusions are often wrong and, as it's said, ""*common sense* is the least common of the senses."" So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to provide a source for your assertion of fact, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. The fact that you think your point is obvious, or common knowledge, or self-evident is irrelevant. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. Don't view them as an assault or a challenge. They're just an invitation to provide knowledge.
* As per [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/49fy8q/meta_rneutralpolitics_passing_60k_subscribers_new/) past announcement, posts that are requests for speculation are no longer be permitted on NeutralPolitics. The answers to speculative questions are inherently handicapped against the rules. Please take your requests for *informed* speculation to /r/NeutralTalk.

To some users, especially the folks firmly in Group B, this period of enforcement is going to seem especially brutal. So be it. Hopefully, you'll find a home in /r/NeutralTalk or elsewhere. For right now, the preservation of four years of work is the mod team's highest priority.

On the other hand, if you want to help us restore the tone of discussion that we set out to foster from the beginning, please review the guidelines, source your assertions, and report content that violates the rules. And if you're really committed, [become a mod!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwm0/meta_neutralpolitics_needs_new_mods/) We need the help.

--------

**Other important notes and changes.**

* We have a new, stricter policy on banning users. Please [read the details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxs5o/meta_new_ban_policy/)

* Most posters don't read the [submission rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) which makes a lot of extra work for moderators. This problem has only increased as our traffic has increased. Fully 60% of submissions never see the light of day in the subreddit. See [here for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwow/meta_neutralpolitics_traffic_and_submission/)

* We'd like to encourage proposals for additions to our [Comment Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/commenthalloffame). If you have a comment you think is deserving, please let us know in the comments! Additionally, the Hall of Fame will now be more prominently featured on our sidebar as a series of model comments.

This bill repeals the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and limits the authority of the Department of Education (ED) such that ED is authorized only to award block grants to qualified states.

The bill establishes an education voucher program, through which each state shall distribute block grant funds among local educational agencies (LEAs) based on the number of eligible children within each LEA's geographical area. From these amounts, each LEA shall: (1) distribute a portion of funds to parents who elect to enroll their child in a private school or to home-school their child, and (2) do so in a manner that ensures that such payments will be used for appropriate educational expenses.

To be eligible to receive a block grant, a state must: (1) comply with education voucher program requirements, and (2) make it lawful for parents of an eligible child to elect to enroll their child in any public or private elementary or secondary school in the state or to home-school their child.

No Hungry Kids Act

The bill repeals a specified rule that established certain nutrition standards for the national school lunch and breakfast programs. (In general, the rule requires schools to increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat free milk in school meals; reduce the levels of sodium, saturated fat, and trans fat in school meals; and meet children's nutritional needs within their caloric requirements.)

As such, the moderation team felt compelled to provide some guidelines to assist all participants in developing their own fact-based understanding of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We acknowledge this post is not typical for /r/NeutralPolitics but the moderation team felt it necessary to push back against the [spread of misinformation](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-RESEARCH/0100B5ES3MG/index.html) in hopes of keeping everyone both well informed and safe. 


***What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?*** 

COVID-19 is a [viral infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in [118 countries across all major continents](https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c88e37cfc43b4ed3baf977d77e4a0667). 

Symptoms appear to occur within [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) after initial exposure, with [one study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) suggesting an average incubation period of 5.1 days. It is possible to be infected with the COVID-19 virus but not show any symptoms of illness, a state known as asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 

Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.

It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.


***COVID-19 Myths and Fact Checking***

As with any developing story, [myths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) are common. Many health agencies and organizations [like the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html) or the [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/communicable-disease/coronavirus) have published simple COVID-19 fact sheets that may be used to verify claims. 


As a general practice it's always good to consider the source, history, evidence, emotion, and pictures (or [SHEEP)](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/5-tips-ways-we-can-all-covid19-check-coronavirus-information-online-fake-disinformation-misinformation/) of a source. Tools like Google's [Fact Checker Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) and Poynter's [International Fact Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/media-news/fact-checking/) may provide additional context. 

***Where can I find the current status of the outbreak?***

The WHO is currently publishing daily [situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). These reports include global morbidity (the state of having the disease) and mortality (death from the disease) counts.  

***How can I protect myself?***

While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Fortunately, there are [many basic protective measures](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) an individual can take to reduce their chance of COVID-19 infection.

* Frequent Hand Washing for at [least 20 seconds](https://ew.com/music/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-wash-songs/)
* Maintain a proper social distance of at least 1 meter or 3 feet between you and others
* Avoid touching your face
* Stay at home if you're not feeling well
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to avoid unnecessarily overwhelming local health systems
* Follow the directions of your local health authority.

How do they differ from Obama's?,NeutralPolitics,"This is the transcript of Hillary Clinton's key comments in the debate about about Russia's actions in Syria, as reported by various news sources http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/transcript-second-debate.html

>Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.

>Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.

>But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it’s all in, in Syria. And they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it’s not me. I’ve stood up to Russia. I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.

>I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that’s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.


>RADDATZ: I’m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?

>I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy.

>I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just…


There are various accusations against the Russians, such as not targeting ISIS, targeting civilians and a call for a no fly zone in Syria. 

The no fly zone is a particularly thorny issue since Hillary claims that there won't be ground troops. Additionally, previous precedent has USA seeking international approval in declaring a no fly zone through the UN security council. The UN has the authority to declare a no fly zone, as it did in Libya, and yet as Russia is a member of the security council with a veto, and the Russians are already in Syria, I am not sure how a no fly zone can be followed.

This article that talks from the perspective of what Russians are worried about and gives more the Russian perspective.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/the-kremlin-really-believes-that-hillary-clinton-will-start-a-war-with-russia-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/

It sees that no fly zone is euphemism for shooting Russian planes. Another way to see the no fly zone, as Hillary Clinton argues is that by following a more assertive pollicy, the USA will have more leverage, and force Russia in negotiations.

Julianne Smith who works for Hillary Clinton's working group for Russia and Europe argued that a no fly zone wouldn't necessarily be implemented by shooting at Russian planes but by forcibly grounding Syrian planes. http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/22/hillary-clintons-new-colder-cold-war-russia-putin-election/

In the last debate Hillary Clinton was asked about what would she do differently than Obama in Syria:
 
>RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?

CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I — if I’m fortunate...

>CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t.

>There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.

>I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders — and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones — made a difference. So I think that could help.

>I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.

Another source on information for the differences in Obama's and Hillary's approaches is this very long article about Obama's foreign pollicy in the Antlantic. The article, called Obama's doctrine is an invaluable source for getting some insight into Obama's perspective. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/

Quoting from it,

>Hillary Clinton, when she was Obama’s secretary of state, argued for an early and assertive response to Assad’s violence. In 2014, after she left office, Clinton told me that “the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad … left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.” When The Atlantic published this statement, and also published Clinton’s assessment that “great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” Obama became “rip-shit angry,” according to one of his senior advisers

Newsom and his allies in the state legislature argue that the bill will help end price gouging and improve the current state of the California rental market.

Under the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/2/enacted) when there is a vote ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government"" there are 14 days for the House to vote affirmative confidence in a new government, or else an early election happens.

The [Cabinet Manual](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60641/cabinet-manual.pdf) (at p. 15, part 2.19) describes the process as follows:

>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act
2011, if a government is defeated on a
motion that ‘this House has no confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, there is
then a 14-day period during which an
alternative government can be formed
from the House of Commons as presently
constituted, or the incumbent government
can seek to regain the confidence of the
House. If no government can secure the
confidence of the House of Commons
during that period, through the approval of
a motion that ‘this House has confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, a general
election will take place. Other decisions
of the House of Commons which have
previously been regarded as expressing ‘no
confidence’ in the government no longer
enable or require the Prime Minister to hold
a general election. **The Prime Minister is
expected to resign where it is clear that he
or she does not have the confidence of the
House of Commons and that an alternative
government does have the confidence.** 

If the Prime Minister does not resign as the Cabinet Manual expects, or there is a dispute as to whether an alternative government does have the confidence of the Commons, does the Queen retain the reserve power of dismissal?

As an initial matter, a [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States) is the requirement that more than a simple over 50% majority of Congress vote in favor of legislation for it to pass.  Depending on what's attempting to be enacted this number can vary from [60% to 80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States).

>In the Senate, a 60-vote supermajority is required to pass most major legislation

>Reconciliation is a procedural mechanism originally intended to quickly clean up minor differences in the spending plans proposed by the Senate and the House by setting aside rules [such as the supermajority requirement] that slow the process. 

Beyond reconciliation there is the possibility of building the wall through executive order. 
 An order to build the wall was made on [January 25, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13767) by President Trump.  However, the funding for the order still apparently [must still come through Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13767#Funding).

Since the signing of that order, Congress has yet to pass adequate funding such that now there is discussion of [whether the executive branch can use existing funds for the border wall](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/12/24/donald-trump-shutdown-congress-approval-build-border-wall-spending-column/2402442002/):

>[T]he White House put out a call to federal agencies to look for “pots of money” in their existing budgets that could be cobbled together to pay for border wall construction. 

This opens a whole host of other questions:

1.  Are there existing funds that are appropriated to something that can legally be argued to be used on a border wall?  I suspect part of the executive branch calling the need for the border wall a national emergency might have something to do with opening the door for existing funds that are earmarked for ""emergencies"" to be made available for the wall;

2.  Is there some type of slush fund the executive branch can use to build the wall?

There are a couple of other cuts whose amounts I can't calculate, but they don't seem to be to large programs.

Adding up the above, it gets to about $5.5 billion in cuts.

To achieve $10500 billion in cuts over 10 years would arithmetically require about $1050 billion in cuts in the first year.  Maybe a bit less if we account for inflation.

The specified cuts are ~0.5% of the total necessary to achieve the stated target.  What would plausibly be the other 99.5% of the cuts?

In 2008, the election was marred from a centrist's perspective by [Sarah Palin's nomination for VP](http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2008/11/five-reasons-th.html/), combined with [stronger unity within the Democratic party](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/politics/08dems.html?_r=0). In 2012, Romney and Ryan ran a [bizzarely poor campaign](https://shadowproof.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-ten-biggest-mistakes/). In 2016, we have only seen the Primaries drama and Trump so far, so centrist voters are naturally alienated—but there is no guarantee the Republican nominee will swing far enough back to the center to entice moderate voters this election.

Politically, I am divided almost 50-50 between Democratic platform and Republican platform. I vote more based on foreign policy than domestic policy matters. I would be happy to consider a viable Republican challenger to Hillary Clinton, if one appears. But the Republican Party still has been unable to produce an appealing candidate in recent years.

894,7g67tq,False,None,9,How does the UK Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011) impact a finding of contempt against a government minister?,NeutralPolitics,"**Background**

There is presently [a controversy over alterations of reports given to the House of Commons related to Brexit by Brexit minister David Davis.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/mps-attack-david-davis-for-handing-over-redacted-brexit-reports)  That controversy has included suggestions, including contempt of Parliament.  Such allegations [would be made to the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, who would then possibly refer it to a committee for adjudication if he found evidence of contempt.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42149793)

Under other Westminster systems, a finding of contempt has been the basis of a no-confidence measure against the government.  Notable recently was the 2011 [fall of the Harper government in Canada on issues of contempt similar to those alleged in the UK.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-government-falls-in-historic-commons-showdown/article4181393/)

Davis is not Prime Minister, but under principles of [collective responsibility of the Government to the Commons](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7755) his position could be attributed to the government as a whole.  It has been argued by Ian Brodie in the Canadian context that [individual impeachment has become depricated by collective responsibility and that if a single minister were found to have lost confidence, it would fell the entire government.](https://parliamentum.org/2017/01/04/on-collective-ministerial-responsibility-and-impeachment/)

However, in 2011 the UK changed electoral laws with the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011)  This law requires that early dissolution requires either a two-thirds vote for a measure that there should be an early election, or else a simple majority must adopt a resolution ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.""

**Question**

How would a finding of contempt of Parliament against a government minister fit into that framework, if not accompanied by the requisite finding of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government to trigger the FTPA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7g67tq/how_does_the_uk_fixed_term_parliaments_act_2011/,288,"The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has [indicated](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/28/david-davis-risk-contempt-parliament-brexit-reports-speaker) that he would be receptive to complaints of contempt, because there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Government's response to the [Commons motion on November 1st](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/28/priti-patel-condemns-mays-brexit-strategy-and-says-eu-should-be-told-to-sod-off-over-money-politics-live?page=with:block-5a1d5ab69ab3f2056cb1cb0c#block-5a1d5ab69ab3f2056cb1cb0c) is adequate. 

The reports are to be delivered to the ""Brexit Committee"", a Commons Select committee that was formed to mirror the new Department for Exiting the European Union, which insists that it has the initialism ""DExEU"", and whose Secretary of State is David Davis.  Hilary Benn, the chairman of that committee has indicated that he is unhappy with the response so far. [Here](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/exiting-the-european-union-committee/publications/) is where the correspondence between Davis and Benn has been published. 

In that correspondence, Davis says that the Government feels that it has satisfied the requirements, Benn says that he is not so sure, and would Davis appear before the committee to explain? The Speaker's comments today appear to mean that Davis *is* in contempt if he does not appear, and that he *might be* in contempt if the committee votes that it is unsatisfied with his appearance.

My reading between the lines leads me to believe that the procedure would be:

* Wait until Davis has appeared before the Brexit committee (it seems that Monday next has been penciled in).

* If he is successful in persuading them that he has given everything that the Commons motion required, he is effectively free of contempt charges, and the argument would move on to who gets to decide what is published from the reports (the committee feels that it is their decision, though they will consider ministers' opinions on the matter).

* If the committee are *not* satisfied, then they will likely subscribe to a letter to the Speaker alleging contempt.

* If the Speaker feels that there is a case to answer, he will propose that the Commons set up another committee to consider the charges. The Government would oppose this, and it would only go ahead if the Commons voted for it against the Government's wishes. The DUP is not obliged by its [confidence and supply agreement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conservative-and-dup-agreement-and-uk-government-financial-support-for-northern-ireland/agreement-between-the-conservative-and-unionist-party-and-the-democratic-unionist-party-on-support-for-the-government-in-parliament) to vote with the Government on this, and several Conservative members expressed dissatisfaction with the Government's response.

* If the committee were set up, it would have to consider carefully and give the Government every chance to back down, but it could eventually recommend a vote in the Commons, and they would suggest possible sanctions.

* the House would have to vote against the Government again to confirm the contempt and the appropriate sanction.

* The Government could propose a motion which negates the effect of the November 1st motion, and if it passed the problem would go away.

* The sanctions could include suspension or expulsion of David Davis from the Commons. This would [put pressure](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05226/SN05226.pdf) on the Prime Minister to either appoint him to the Lords, or maintain him as a minister without him being accountable to Parliament, or dismiss him as a minister. Her action or inaction on this could easily be the subject of a no-confidence motion in the proper form for the FTPA. 

* There is nothing to stop the Opposition from proposing a proper no-confidence motion at any time (and the current practice of the Government is to order its MPs not to vote on Opposition motions!) but the DUP *are* obliged under the confidence and supply agreement to support the Government on this.

* The Government also has the option of proposing a confidence vote, making it clear that voting confidence in them would supersede the November 1st vote (""if you have confidence in the Government, you must allow them to govern in the way it sees fit"").

So the Commons can throw a member out, and that would place the PM in a difficult position if the member were a minister, and the PM didn't want to sack the minister. The PM's response to such a crisis could easily be the pretext for a proper no-confidence vote in the Government. It is entirely possible for the Commons to have the votes to expel a minister, but not the Prime Minister or the Government (you could have a ""no confidence in the Prime Minister"" vote which, if lost, would force the PM to resign but not risk an early election), although the distinction could seem jesuitical until it happens. 

How the Commons votes is the only thing that matters, what they say and what their party membership cards say are irrelevant.

Just to be pedantic on the FTPA, a no-confidence vote is followed by a two-week period in which a new Government might be formed, or the previous Government might regain the confidence of the Commons. If that period expires, or if there is the two-thirds vote, an early election is called. 

It is interesting to note that both major parties have procedures for electing new leaders which last longer than the no-confidence/early election scenario, and so an election could be held where a major party had no leader.

I use ""substantially left leaning changes"" to mean left leaning relative to Hillary Clinton. Compare [Sanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Political_positions) and [Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Clinton#As_described_by_others). (The assumption being that the more center leaning a President is, the easier it is to mostly agree to him/her for Congress, and by extension his/her proposed bills.)

I am looking at these promises he made in terms of feasibility of implementation:

*     He will break up big financial institutions. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/). He has also promised to remove private bank(er)s from the board of the federal reserve. [Read more](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/23/bernie-sanders-wall-street-federal-reserve-bankers).
*    Break up lobbying by regulating how campaigns receive funding, promoting small donations. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-in-politics/).

To what extent will factors like scope of presidential authority, Congress, big financial institutions, allied countries etc. influence the feasibility of implementing these policies?

As an example while Barack Obama is the current President: 

* He  wanted to shutdown Guantanamo Bay and Congress said [nope](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30826649/ns/politics-capitol_hill/). 
* He campaigned for raise of minimum wage, but only a few states [agreed](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamas-2014-report-card).

>A plurality electoral system is one where ballots are normally not valid unless they have been marked by the voter to indicate the candidate or candidates that the voter wishes to have elected, but no more candidates can be indicated in this way than the number of vacancies to be filled, without invalidating the ballot, so the information that voters are allowed to provide about their ranking of the candidates in their order of preference for them is deliberately and unnecessarily limited. Each candidate marked gets equal value from the vote, as voters cannot indicate their preferred priority among the candidates. Each mark is thus a first preference vote, but there is no provision for any later preferences of voters for candidates with more votes than they need - or of the candidates with the fewest votes - to be indicated, for transfer to remaining continuing candidates.

Following President Trump's [private meeting](https://apnews.com/afd7db4f7c024a678c696da68edd15ce) with Putin in Helsinki, [Senate Democrats expressed concerns](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/19/helsinki-summit-democrats-want-hear-trumps-interpreter/799733002/) about the meeting and requested the interpreter testify before them in a closed session so they could ascertain what, if anything, was agreed to.  

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee also attempted to subpoena the interpreter, but were [blocked by the Republicans on the Committee.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-democrat-attempt-subpoena-trump-interpreter/story?id=56687970) 

Based on this, a few questions arise:

1. Is is legal to force an interpreter for the President to testify via subpoena?

2. Are there ethical complications in doing so?

3. Is there precedent for calling an interpreter to testify?

>Senior members of Angela Merkel’s party defended her refugee policy after the German chancellor’s approval rating plunged in the wake of a series of attacks that unsettled the public and sparked political opposition.

> Voter support for Merkel slumped 12 percentage points to 47 percent in July, the second-lowest of her third term that started in 2013, according to an Infratest dimap poll this week for ARD public television.

Which got me thinking, who receives more public benefits, veterans or illegal immigrants?

&nbsp;

In 1996, ""welfare reform legislation specifically limited the eligibility of immigrant households to receive assistance."" [Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272702001883)

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding what federal programs are still available to undocumented immigrants, and many public assistance programs vary on a state-by-state basis. 

&nbsp;

Some benefits available to Veterans can be found on the US Department of Veterans Affairs website [here](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/). These benefits are exclusive to veterans of the US armed forces and their families.

&nbsp;

Some factors to consider, but are not limited to: 


* Housing
* Food assistance
* Long term healthcare
* Emergency healthcare
* Mental healthcare services

Is there risk involved when attempting to receive public benefits as an undocumented or illegal immigrant?

The outage took place during cold spike in NY and was widely disruptive to inmates, leaving them with no light, hot water, or heat.

It drew [crowds of protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/nyregion/brooklyn-federal-jail-heat.html) and the attention of [some lawmakers and elected officials](https://www.apnews.com/fdc41f64df494c0c94cd918e1da1757f):

> U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez says she visited the jail with other elected officials Saturday and the heat was uneven and sporadic. She said the inmates had no light in their cells and they “are very angry and complaining.”

The Metropolitan Detention Center has previously been embroiled in issues of mistreatment of prisoners (From the first link):

> After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the inspector general found that officers slammed Muslim inmates face-first against walls and told them they would die in secret. The inspector general also participated in an investigation into the beatings of two inmates by officers in 2002 and 2006.

> More recently, an investigation focused on officers who sexually assaulted female inmates who were on overnight cleaning duty between 2013 and 2016. Two former M.D.C. lieutenants and a correction officer were convicted, including one lieutenant who repeatedly raped a prisoner and threatened to send her to solitary confinement if she reported it.

> Last year, another inspector general report condemned conditions for women housed in an adjacent building. The women were confined to one floor with almost no natural light or time outside.  

This has sparked a request for an 'outside monitor' (From the 1st link):

> Lawyers with the federal defenders, which represents hundreds of inmates at the jail, filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a Brooklyn federal judge to appoint an outside monitor who would have unfettered access to the jail.

> “The I.G. previously has investigated M.D.C. and issued harshly critical reports,” said Ms. von Dornum, the federal defender. “But nothing has changed.”

An 'outside' or ['independent monitor'](https://nypost.com/2019/02/04/judge-orders-lawyers-be-allowed-to-visit-metropolitan-detention-center-inmates/), is probably making reference to a *court appointed monitor* that [has been used](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2019-01-18/federal-monitor-gives-newark-police-mixed-grades-in-report) in institutional [corruption cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/nyregion/nycha-federal-monitor-repairs.html) before.

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy issued [Executive Order 10925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10925) in order to ""take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."" A few years later, following Kennedy's assassination, LBJ brokered the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) through congress, and followed up in 1965 with [Executive Order 11246](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246), later amended with [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375), to include sex-based discrimination in the laws, and ""to correct the effects of past and present discrimination."" Since, there have been [many cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Legal_history) of expanded regulation and court rulings to expand on how these laws and Executive Orders effect our country.

Looking at [data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2014](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/archive/labor-force-characteristics-by-race-and-ethnicity-2014.pdf) and the [U.S. Census Bureau data from 2015](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/RHI125215/00), it appears that unemployment rates are about double for certain minorities (Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Two or More Races; exact numbers available in BLS report, Table 1). However, if we look at the racial breakdown of our workforce, and compare it to the Census data, the representation appears to be very close to equal, despite the higher unemployment rates of certain minorities.

Can we say beyond a reasonable doubt that affirmative action has either worked or failed? Is race-based affirmative action an effective course of legislation for the United States, instead of something like class-based affirmative action?

The last one requires some explanation; I think that if house and senate candidates were chosen by lottery instead of by the two party system a lot of the rampant corruption currently displayed by congress would disappear, congress would participate more in hearings/debates, and in general would conduct itself more as a body interested in the well being of the people it represents rather than a completely foreign body with its own private interests. The lottery's selection body would have to meet criteria already stipulated by the constitution, e.g. age and residency, but it would probably be wise to stipulate further requirements such as a minimum education requirement.

Back to the 28th amendment, why can't the 28th amendment include two or more of the ideas above? Because most of the ideas I've listed are not inter-compatible, with the possible exception of the last two. A constitutional amendment needs to be a discrete unit of legislation, not a 2000 page boondoggle with earmarks and sections for special interests for as far as the eyes can read. A constitutional amendment needs to be simple so that it can be interpreted in as few ways as possible, and in a time where the last constitutional amendment was ratified 11 years ago, a new amendment would need to be something easy to swallow that a majority of the American people support.

There is a hostile atmosphere and censorship, in addition with bad and sometimes insulting behavior from the user and moderator team and being aggressive and insulting towards people with not leftist viewpoints, and this definetly harms discussion.  For example, someone who disagrees with open border immigration is being highly downvoted, and attacked that directly discouraged me from posting.

I highly recommend reading the whole thing, but the gist of it is this: given a math problem relating to the efficacy of a skin cream, people got the answers right according to their individual mathematical ability (numeracy), but given *the same data* relating to the efficacy of gun control laws, people were more likely to answer according to their political beliefs. What's more, respondents with higher numeracy were actually *more* likely to be affected by their bias.

So, if facts don't trump bias, even in those people best equipped to analyze the facts, what hope do we have of producing effective policies? And to get meta, what is the point of this subreddit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1ov3n2/how_can_we_hope_to_build_consensus_when_even/,269,">While the fake study data that they were supposed to assess remained the same, sometimes the study was described as measuring the effectiveness of a “new cream for treating skin rashes.” 

>But in other cases, the study was described as involving the effectiveness of “a law banning private citizens from carrying concealed handguns in public.”

But skin rashes are inherently bad (at least, I hope you all agree they are"" and instances of them occurring because there wasn't any regime of cream applied is inherently bad.

Guns being carried in public isn't inherently bad.

Guns being carried in public isn't inherently bad.

Guns being carried legally in public isn't inherently bad.

Gun crime being committed via breaking laws against carrying in public is inherently bad.

Gun crime being committed in public by taking advantage of laws permitting carrying in public is inherently bad.

*All of these are distinct*

However, the period between 1994 and 2008 saw the demolition of nearly 270,000 units of public housing stock, a decrease of about 19% despite the U.S. population *increasing* 16% over the same period.

[healthcare.gov outlines the exemption rules as follows:](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/results/2016/details/marketplace-affordability)

> Coverage is considered to be unaffordable if the lowest cost Bronze-level plan available to you through the Marketplace in 2016 is more than 8.13% of your household income.

> The total cost to you must be more than 8.13%, accounting for any premium tax credit you would qualify for if you enrolled in that plan.

> If you qualify for this exemption, it may apply to everybody on your tax return.

This sounds completely reasonable and it would surprise me if there really are many people who will unavoidably incur the penalty.

Is there really a coverage gap? If so, how significant is this problem? What estimates have been published for the number of Americans that are uninsured because they do not have an employer that provides health insurance, cannot afford an ACA plan, do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, and are not merely refusing or neglecting to purchase a plan? Are there many people who have no other coverage and cannot reasonably afford ACA or do most of these people instead just not *want* to pay for coverage?

If the gap does exist and affects many people, why does it exist? Was it purely an oversight in the ACA itself or is it somehow the unforeseen consequence of a mix of factors?

Here's [an example](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/21/news/economy/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-texas/) of an article talking about the coverage gap.

Economic sanctions are for the most part imposed on individual entities, not countries (there are some exceptions, like the [embargo on trade between the USA and Cuba](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/cuba/)). These entities are in some cases arms of national governments (stated-owned enterprises, government officials, militias, government agencies, etc). They can also be private citizens or private companies. In fact, these sanctions are not even imposed directly on most of the SDNs: Treasury ultimately enforces SDN sanctions by [imposing civil penalties](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen) (fines) on Western companies and individuals, since they represent the only entities over which OFAC has enforceable jurisdiction. As an example see [this case against TD Bank in January 2017](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/CivPen/Documents/20170113_td_bank.pdf), in which the bank agreed to pay about $0.5 million for voluntarily self-disclosed (presumably inadvertent) violations of Iran and Cuba-related asset control regulations.

The [Iran-related sanctions that were imposed on February 3, 2017](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20170203.aspx) do not solely target Iranian entities. Some of the 25 individuals and firms targeted are reportedly from Iran, but others are from Kuwait, the UAE, China, and Lebanon.

In economic terms, the actual substance of this round of sanctions does not appear to be all that different from what we've seen in previous rounds under Bush and Obama. But in keeping with what some other commenters have already said, the critical issue here may not be the economic impact of the sanctions, but rather the administration's very conscious choice to use this as a means of [arguably counterproductive saber-rattling](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827118012784373760).

1) Example of a piece mostly putting this into the context of original Obama-Trump conflict, the birther episode: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/obamagate-birtherism-all-over-again/611692/

i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?

ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?

iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?

iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?

v) Aside from embarking on an ambitious research project to find truth every time something happens, is there any way to actually know what is happening during stories like this? Are there go-to sources that can be universally trusted when it comes to deciphering alleged political scandals?

So (i believe) the court is making a clear distinction between discrimination based on a person's belief in general and religious expression outside of work, and religious expression while at work, and as long as it's applied equally it's ok, at least in regards to visible religious symbols. 

In the USA the [""free exercise clause""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Exercise_Clause) doesn't seem applicable to this situation and the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act)  doesn't seem to apply either. 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires an employer (with at least 15 employees, including private sector, state, and local government employers, as well as employment agencies, unions, and federal government agencies), once it is aware that a religious accommodation is needed, to accommodate an employee whose sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance conflicts with a work requirement. [eeoc.gov](https://www1.eeoc.gov//eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm?renderforprint=1) 

I believe that would mean that currently those employers mentioned above would not be allowed to prohibit an employee from wearing visibile religious symbols. 

Can employers not mentioned, prohibit employees from wearing visible religious symbols? 

And what would it take to allow all employers to prohibit that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5zfbtq/the_eu_court_of_justice_ruled_that_private/,252,"I believe this is what ""freedom of religion"" should be about... but of course, not what it is about.

990,5t4dbj,False,None,66,"Is the 9th Circuit really ""the most liberal and overturned circuit"" in the history of the USA?",NeutralPolitics,"After the recent decision by the 9th Circuit to continue barring Trump's immigration restrictions there has been some backlash on conservative leaning media, concerning the history and reputation of the 9th Circuit:

Fox News has recently written an article that says: 

>It routinely is the most overturned court in the U.S. In 2012, the Supreme Court reversed 86 percent of the rulings it reviewed from the ninth.

and that

>Critics deride the court, calling it the “Ninth Circus” and the “Nutty Ninth.”

http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/02/09/ninth-circuit-most-overturned-court-us

The LA Times also has an article about the 9th Circuit from September of last year on the subject of it's alleged left-leaning bias. To quote: 

>The court’s reputation for leftist judicial activism is so legendary that conservative groups mount perennial efforts to split up the 44-judge court, the largest in the nation. In 2011, Newt Gingrich called for abolishing the “anti-American” circuit outright.

The article discusses some of it's historical appointments and liberal biases but comes to the conclusion that it's overturn rate is due to the size of its region and the huge amount of cases it sees. 

On the other hand liberal-leaning news sources (in my opinion) such as ABC take the stance that the liberal reputation of the 9th Circuit is overblown. According to ABC the 9th Circuit appears very liberal because of the large influx of appointees in Carter's administration. ABC says that these ""Carter"" judges are too advanced in age to matter or are simply dead. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/scholars-liberal-reputation-9th-circuit-overblown-45316853

>But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter's appointees — who were considered extremely liberal — have taken semi-retired ""senior"" status or passed away.

Other organizations such as the American Bar Association have rated the 9th Circuit very poorly and has given it the second lowest grade of any federal circuit. 

http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/intelprop/magazine/LandslideJan2010_Hofer.authcheckdam.pdf

The 13 Circuits are graded by their performances with respect to Supreme Court decisions in the above .pdf link.  

I noticed that the 9th Circuit is actually the second most overturned court. I also noticed that the 6th and 10th Circuits are of, essentially, the same caliber in terms of being overturned by SCOTUS. 

Only 14/44 of the active and open seats (only 4 vacant seats at the moment) in the 9th Circuit have been appointed by conservative presidents ( Reagan, Bush Jr and Sr, and Nixon). The rest have been appointed by Carter, Clinton, and Obama. 

Is the 9th Circuit truly a liberal biased court, in the way certain media outlets are making them out to be? Do they suffer from overturns because they have the largest geographical spread of any Circuit? What historical context should we consider when discussing the reputation of the 9th Circuit? How much does the size of the 9th Circuit's region really affect the dispositions of this circuit?

991,50h6gw,False,None,80,"Is there any evidence, in practice, which suggests that a tax on carbon will have wide-spread economic benefits?",NeutralPolitics,"This morning, CNN put out [an article](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/investing/hillary-clinton-climate-change-joseph-stiglitz-advice/) quoting Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has previously worked as the Senior Vice President of the World Bank, [has spoken against the TPP](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/in-2016-better-trade-agreements-trans-pacific-partnership), and who wrote in 2007 an article for The Guardian entitled, [""Carbon-Taxing the Rich""](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/07/carbontaxingtherich), in which he laments the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol -- affirming his belief that a cap-and-trade system is too soft on companies who pollute, and doesn't provide enough deterrent: 

>""...polluting industries like the cap-and-trade system. While it provides them an incentive not to pollute, emission allowances offset much of what they would have to pay under a tax system. Some firms can even make money off the deal. Moreover, Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade, and many are loathe to try an alternative. Yet, no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights.""

What both this article and the CNN article seem to miss is the specific economic analysis of such a system. Europe, as Stiglitz mentioned, has become used to a Cap-and-Trade system, although some countries in Northern Europe had already begun to tax carbon at the time of the article, and some (such as [Ireland](http://www.nesc.ie/assets/files/downloads/project_climate%20change/ucd_workshop/ericgargan.pdf)) have since implemented a system which places a price on emissions. So while there has been hesitation in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax#Implementation) to introduce such a tax, there ought to be enough of a sample that economic benefits can be seen and analyzed. David Suzuki, [on his website](http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-solutions/carbon-tax-or-cap-and-trade/), mentions that Sweden's economy has more than doubled since they brought in a carbon tax -- though this was in 1991, and the growth might be due to other factors. 

Stiglitz, however, believes the evidence is clear: ""I think a carbon tax would stimulate the economy.""

992,4qfmn2,False,None,119,Why did youths vote for remain on Brexit referendum when their unemployment rate is so high?,NeutralPolitics,"[This FT article includes the graph that shows the turnout rate of youth populations](http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2016/06/24/brexit-demographic-divide-eu-referendum-results/). ~~Overwhelming majority of them voted for remain.~~ EDIT: [it appears that actual numbers of youths who voted were very few](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/06/brexit-vote-one-chart).

[Youth unemployment rate in the UK has been worsened off](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure) however. [In 2010 it marked the highest in past 17 years; 19.6%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts). Currently it stands at [13.4%](http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/), seems much more lowered in this five years but nevertheless, double the amount of Germany (6.9%) or [Japan (5.8%)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts), and I assume it is still in the higher bracket.

The reason I came up with this question is because of the strong correlation between unemployment, lesser education, low income and the Brexit vote (as shown in the FT article I posted above). If we assume job dissatisfaction was the core issue of Brexit vote, how come youths voted for remain instead of leave?

I acknowledge that youths are generally liberal, and they benefit a lot from free movement and ability to get educations or meet different people in different places of Europe. Nevertheless, if their job condition is not satisfactory, I still wonder why it almost didn't have any noticeable impact.

Just want to point out I'm only an undergrad interested in this issue so a lot of my presumptions may be wrong, and I'm all happy and open to acknowledge and fix my errors. Thanks in advance.

---**EDIT**---

Thanks for many responses. There one point that I want to make it clear:

* I made a debatable premise that people with difficult economic circumstances voted for Brexit. Indeed it doesn't make any sense at a glance as Brexit will hurt the national economy more. But then again, a lot of people speculate that they didn't vote rationally. Also, statistics from the FT article shows strong correlation between lower income / unemployment and Brexit support. Finally, many of their arguments such as about £350 million to be taken back or immigrants taking their jobs, are in my opinion, manifesting that their Brexit vote were stemming from their economic dissatisfaction *they perceived* as resulted from joining the EU.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4qfmn2/why_did_youths_vote_for_remain_on_brexit/,250,[removed] ,2016-06-29 13:55:32

I’m very excited to be here to discuss issues that I care deeply about, and I hope you find this discussion informative and useful. 

Some background about myself: I was born in Schenectady, New York and grew up mostly in Vancouver, Canada. I was a reporter for much of my career, and worked for a decade for a British newspaper, the Financial Times, where I was most recently the Washington bureau chief. I came to CFR almost 10 years ago now and wrote a book on U.S. immigration policy after 9/11, called [The Closing of the American Border](http://www.amazon.com/Closing-American-Border-Terrorism-Immigration/dp/0061558400/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256826006&sr=8-2). I have continued to work on immigration and border security issues, which of course have become no less controversial than when I joined CFR. I also covered U.S. trade policy as a reporter dating back to the negotiations on NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). My recent work at CFR has been heavily focused on U.S. trade policy and American economic competitiveness. 

We have just released a new book called [How America Stacks Up](http://www.cfr.org/competitiveness/america-stacks-up/p37438?cid=soc-Reddit-in-Alden_AMA-How_America_Stacks_Up), which looks at how the United States compares with other advanced economies on a range of policies that are critical for success in global economic competition – such as education, infrastructure, tax policy, worker retraining and innovation. We told the story in part through the use of infographics that distill the big conclusions in graphic form, and I encourage you to have a look. 

All of my publications can be found [here](http://www.cfr.org/experts/economics-immigration-trade-competitiveness/edward-alden/b2472#publications), so feel free to browse beforehand if you have the time.

I use evil here instead of naming certain parties to keep this neutral. Evil being the opposite party you don't want to win.

So for example, if Trump is Republican candidate, Hillary is Democratic, it wouldn't serve Hillary's campaign (or liberals) for Bernie to run independent because in the event of a statistical tie, the House would vote for Trump. However, if someone like Bloomberg ran independent, the vote tied, the house would choose Bloomberg or Trump.  It won't help Hillary for a third party candidate who can draw real votes to run in this election.  Best case scenario for Hillary would be to get a crazy-strong VP (normally VP's don't determine campaigns but if they're really strong and well known do drive voters, i.e. Bernie's voters, this could make Hillary's campaign stronger and bring out the vote).

997,5oqm2u,False,None,43,Is what Rep. Tom Price did by buying stocks and introducing legislation shortly afterwards illegal/unethical?,NeutralPolitics,"By now most of you have read or heard of this article from CNN:

http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/tom-price-bill-aiding-company/

> Rep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Price bought between $1,001 to $15,000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet, according to House records reviewed by CNN. Less than a week after the transaction, the Georgia Republican congressman introduced the HIP Act, legislation that would have delayed until 2018 a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation that industry analysts warned would significantly hurt Zimmer Biomet financially once fully implemented. After Price offered his bill to provide Zimmer Biomet and other companies relief from the CMS regulation, the company's political action committee donated to the congressman's reelection campaign, records show.

------------------------------

So this article establishes that Tom Price bought shares of stock in Zimmer Biomet in March, introduced legislation particularly shielding it from CMS regulations less than a week later, AND Zimmer Biomet contributed to Price's campaign re-election bid.

[Legislation source](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4848)

[Zimmer Biomet campaign contributions source](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&cmte=C00399386)

--------------------------

**COUNTER ARGUMENT**

Yesterday I read a twitter thread from one of Price's former staffers, and her claims are the following:

http://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2017/01/17/journalistic-malpractice-ellen-carmichael-debunks-cnn-story-on-rep-tom-price-stock-purchase/

> @RepTomPrice has a Morgan Stanley brokered-directed stock portfolio. He is not personally engaged in trades made on his behalf.

> In March 2016, his broker rebalanced his portfolio and included the purchase of $2,697.74 Zimmer Biomet stock, among others

> Price was unaware of March 17 stock purchase until April 4. He immediately disclosed his financials on April 15, 2016, 11 days later.

> CNN says that @RepTomPrice introduced legislation after purchasing stock. This is demonstrably false. Work on this began in 2015!

---------------------

Essentially her claim is that Tom Price's portfolio isn't managed by him, and he has no knowledge of stocks he purchases. She claims his broker purchased the stock on March 17, made aware of it on April 4, and disclosed his financials on April 15. Furthermore, she claims that since work began on the legislation in September of 2015, there can be no conflict of interest because he hadn't purchased stocks yet.

This, for me, raises a few questions:

* Could Tom Price have struck his name from the legislation to completely remove himself once he learned he had bought stocks in their company?

* Is there any way to verify that Tom Price truly has no knowledge of what his broker does with his stock portfolio? What's stopping Price from just calling up his broker and saying ""Hey buy these stocks I'm about to pass this legislation""?

* Can people still be held ethically liable if they have a broker making stock purchases on their behalf?

* And lastly, with the evidence provided here, does anyone have enough legal expertise to conclude that what Tom Price did was illegal/unethical?
